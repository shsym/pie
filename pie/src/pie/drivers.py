"""Driver registry — maps `type = "..."` strings to driver implementations.

Each inference driver (pie_backend_vllm, pie_backend, pie_backend_dummy,
future siblings like pie_backend_sglang) registers a `DriverSpec` here on
package import. `pie/server.py` consults the registry to dispatch a model
to the right worker module without hardcoding driver names.

Driver selection at TOML level:

    [model.qwen-small.driver]
    type = "vllm"           # ← discriminator looked up here

    [model.qwen-small.driver.vllm]
    # vllm-specific fields, parsed into DriverSpec.config_cls

Each driver's `config_cls` is a typed dataclass whose field names mirror
that driver's native API (e.g., `VllmDriverConfig` mirrors vllm's
`EngineArgs` field names exactly). No translation layer.
