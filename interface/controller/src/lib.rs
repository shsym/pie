//! pie-controller-rpc — the controller's control-plane RPC contract.
//!
//! Unifies two things that used to live apart:
//!   * the control-plane **data vocabulary** (registry / liveness / routing
//!     types, formerly the schema crate's `control` module), and
//!   * the `Control` **tarpc service** that carries them (formerly a separate
//!     thin RPC crate).
//!
//! Workers and gateways dial the controller through the macro-generated
//! [`ControlClient`]; the controller implements [`Control`]. The controller
//! keeps a registry of workers + gateways, pushes each worker its [`Neighbors`]
//! (TP siblings + prefill↔decode partners) and each gateway the [`RoutingTable`]
//! (worker roster + coarse load) via long-poll watches, and tracks liveness from
//! heartbeats.
//!
//! These are plain serde — deliberately NOT rkyv (`#[schema]`): the control
//! plane is cross-node, low-rate Rust↔Rust and never rides the zero-copy tensor
//! ring, so it is NOT part of `SCHEMA_HASH`. Cluster-unique id atoms
//! ([`WorkerId`]/[`GatewayId`]/[`NodeId`]) come from the leaf `pie-ids` crate and
//! are re-exported here for ergonomics.
