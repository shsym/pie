//! Gateway↔worker data-plane RPC interface — the `GatewayInbound` +
//! `WorkerControl` tarpc services, the turn vocabulary they carry, and the
//! shared two-way connection glue that splits one socket into both.
//!
//! Post-inversion (Pie 0.5.0) the worker dials INTO the gateway (1:N fan-in):
//! the gateway is the listening server, the worker the client. One
//! worker-initiated connection carries BOTH traits, split at each end with
//! [`spawn_twoway`] (the heavy token traffic stays on the plain client→server
//! direction; latency-sensitive commands go reverse):
//!
//! - [`GatewayInbound`] — served by the GATEWAY, called by the worker. Bulk,
//!   forward: token push + register + load report + redirect.
//! - [`WorkerControl`] — served by the WORKER, called by the gateway.
//!   Latency-sensitive, varied: dispatch + cancel + set_priority + drain.
//!
//! The macros generate `GatewayInboundClient` (held by the worker) and
//! `WorkerControlClient` (held by the gateway, one per connected worker in its
//! registry). The crate also owns the shared two-way connection glue that splits
//! the one worker→gateway socket into both service channels — see [`link`]
//! ([`spawn_twoway`] + the typed [`accept_gateway_link`] /
//! [`connect_gateway_link`] constructors). It is defined ONCE here so the muxed
//! frame's wire layout and the channel ordering can't drift between the two ends.
//!
//! The wire data types (`Request`/`Accepted`/`Tokens`/`BlobRef`/`Priority`/
//! `Control`) live in [`data`] and are flat-re-exported at the crate root, so a
//! consumer reaches them as `pie_worker_rpc::Request`. The id atoms come from
//! [`pie_ids`]; the embedded turn payload (`ClientMessage`/`ServerMessage`) and
//! the reused `WorkerStatus` come from the sibling interface crates per the
//! restructure DAG: `pie-worker-rpc → { pie-ids, pie-client-api,
//! pie-controller-rpc }`.
//!
//! NOTE — this `WorkerControl` is the gateway↔worker DATA plane (dispatch a
//! turn). It is unrelated to the worker's CONTROL-plane embed seam, which is
//! named `ControlLink` (`pie-worker`, register/heartbeat/report/watch against
//! the controller). Two different surfaces, two different names (manager M2).
