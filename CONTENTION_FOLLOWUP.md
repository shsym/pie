# KV contention — root-cause diagnosis and proposed redesign

Written 2026-07-25, on `dev` @ `713f76b17` (RTX 4090, Qwen3-0.6B, hard KV cap
via the driver option `total_pages`). Raw records and runner scripts:
`~/Workspace/pie-wt/vllm-compare-records/` and the scratchpad
`matrix2/`, `traced/`, `traced2/` directories.

§§1–5 are **measurement**: what breaks, and why, each claim tied to a captured
run or a unit test. §6 is a **proposal** — not implemented, not signed off.
§§7–11 are operational notes.

**This supersedes the first draft of this file.** That draft blamed
"continuous admission of young work" and framed the problem as a layering /
admission-control gap. Both claims are refuted below by direct measurement.

---

## 1. The finding

Under sustained KV pressure the engine does not degrade and does not thrash —
it **livelocks**. The GPU goes to **0% utilization and stays there**, while the
reclaim ladder spins at roughly **5,000 futile victim escalations per second**,
every one of which frees zero pages.

The mechanism is a single closed loop:

1. The queue head cannot get its pages (in the captured run it needed **4**
   pages out of a 2,151-page pool).
2. `escalate` posts a park request to a victim younger than the head.
3. The victim reaches its safe point, freezes its pipeline, and calls
   `KvStore::prepare_suspend`.
4. `prepare_suspend` → `PageTable::private_resident_pages` returns an **empty**
   page set and reports `SuspendDisposition::NothingReclaimable` — because the
   victim selected in step 2 was **holding no KV pages at all** (§3).
5. `suspend_at_safe_point` returns `Ok(false)`; the `ParkGuard` declines the
   park, resumes the pipeline, and the process goes back to `Running`.
6. Nothing was freed, the head is still short, so go to 2.

Neither of the two counters that would have made this visible existed:
`NothingReclaimable` was an unreported early return, and `escalate` had no
counter for "posted" vs "found nobody". Both were added for this investigation
(§8).

## 1b. Status update (2026-07-25) — three stacked root causes, two fixed

Fixing the livelock above did not recover the workload; it exposed a second
wedge, and fixing that exposed a third. Each was confirmed by counters/dumps,
not inference. All on the 256-request pressure config of §9:

| state                          | completed | tok/s | evidence of the next wall |
|--------------------------------|-----------|-------|---------------------------|
| baseline                       | 34/256    | 193   | `nothing_reclaimable=204,859`, GPU 0% |
| + fix 1: victim selection (§3, E3) | 38/256 | 216   | `nothing_reclaimable=0`, but `sealed=0`, seal watchdog expired |
| + fix 2: seal key-space bug    | 89/256    | 506   | `sealed=1` **and** `in_flight_launches (0)` — sealed frame never posts |
| + fix 3: queue-order deadlock  | 256/256 (4 of 5 runs) | 8,000–9,090 | 0.80–0.91x of the ideal-admission ceiling (M1 conc-61: 9,949); 1 of 5 runs falls into an intermittent THRASH regime instead (§12.5) |

- **Fix 1 (implemented)** — `select_costed` reclassified: covering holders
  outrank partial holders outrank no-opinion outrank provably-useless;
  `ReclaimQuote::Nothing` victims are never posted (§3, §6.3 E3).
- **Fix 2 (implemented)** — `on_lane_leave` cleaned the process-keyed maps
  (`staged`, `joins_in_flight`, `pending_binds`) with a **pipeline-scope key**,
  so a process that parked during KV acquire *before its first fire* stayed in
  `joins_in_flight` forever and held the seal gate (`joining == true`). The
  leave notification now carries `(lane, owner)` through
  `reclaim.rs → worker.rs → frame.rs`.
- **Fix 3 (implemented)** — a three-party queue-order deadlock: sealed frame
  ⇄ standalone-copy barrier ⇄ pool resize. Barrier removed, standalone copies
  dispatch out-of-band, settling copies no longer hold frame posting.
  Mechanism in §12, fix in §12.4, verification in §12.5. Residual: an
  intermittent thrash regime (1 of 5 runs) owned by the §6 policy remainder,
  not the dispatch layer.

## 2. The evidence

### 2.1 It is a livelock, not a slowdown

Instrumented run, 256 requests / concurrency 128 / `total_pages 2151` /
`swap_pool_size 4096`, sampling the orchestrator every 500 ms:

| sample | waiters | free | head needs | suspends | restores | park requests posted | nothing_reclaimable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 55 | 41 | 84 | 0 |
| 11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 491 | 424 | 783 | **0** |
| 12 | 34 | 0 | 4 | **493** | **474** | 2,527 | **1,769** |
| 36 | 35 | 0 | 4 | **493** | **474** | 61,379 | 60,622 |
| 72 | 34 | 0 | 4 | **493** | **474** | 150,111 | 149,354 |

For the first ~6 seconds the ladder works perfectly: 491 suspends, 424
restores, ~11,000 pages moved, and `nothing_reclaimable` is **exactly zero**.
Then it flips, permanently and completely:

- `suspends` and `restores` never advance again — 493/474 for the remaining
  ~80 seconds.
- `posted` and `nothing_reclaimable` climb in lockstep at ~5,000/s, their
  difference pinned at a constant ~757. **Essentially every park request now
  ends in a victim with nothing to give.**
- 93 processes sit permanently in `ParkRequested`.
- The pool stays at **0 of 2,151 free** while the head asks for **4 pages**.
- Host swap sits at **4,079 of 4,096 slots free** — the swap rung is never
  even reached.
- D7 progress-deadline kills do fire (~1 per 10 s deadline window) and
  **release nothing**; the pool never gains a page from them.

### 2.2 The GPU is completely idle

`nvidia-smi` sampled at 1 Hz across both runs, model resident throughout:

| run | GPU utilization | duration |
|---|---|---|
| concurrency 128 (livelocked) | **0% in 82 of 82 samples, mean 0.0%** | 82 s |
| concurrency 61 (healthy) | mean **82.6%**, 13/14 samples >50% | 14 s |

Thrashing would show PCIe traffic and periodic compute. This shows neither.

### 2.3 The cliff is at exactly the resident-capacity boundary

Each request is 36 prompt + 512 output = 548 tokens = 35 pages; 2,151 pages
therefore hold **61** requests at full length. Sweeping only
`max_concurrent_processes`, everything else identical:

| concurrency | oversubscription | late arrivals | completed | wall | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 61 | **1.00x** | 195 | **256/256** | 13.2 s | **9,949** |
| 90 | 1.48x | 166 | 5/256 | 90 s (timeout) | 28 |
| 128 | 2.10x | 128 | 34/256 | 90 s (timeout) | 193 |
| 128 (192 requests) | 2.10x | 64 | 74/192 | 90 s (timeout) | 421 |
| 128 (128 requests) | 2.10x | **0** | **128/128** | 9.6 s | 6,861 |

The concurrency-61 run emitted **zero** contention-trace lines: the queue was
never non-empty. So that row is not "contention handled well", it is
"contention never engaged". The last row survives because the fixed cohort
finishes before pressure peaks — 64 extra requests (row 4) is enough to kill it.

### 2.4 Continuous admission is NOT the cause — the first draft was wrong

The concurrency-61 run has **195 late arrivals**, more than any failing row,
and completes flawlessly. Arrival of newly admitted young work is exonerated.
The variable that matters is whether the admitted set exceeds resident KV
capacity for long enough to force a suspension that cannot be satisfied.

### 2.5 The gap against vLLM is not an admission-policy gap

vLLM at the **identical** 34,416-token KV budget (`GPU KV cache size: 34,416
tokens`, confirmed in its log), told the **same** nominal concurrency
(`max_num_seqs = 128`), on the same 256-request workload: **256/256 in 9.3 s at
14,158 tok/s**. It never wedges because its scheduler simply runs the subset
that fits. pie at the same settings delivers 193 tok/s.

## 3. Root cause: the ladder keeps choosing victims that hold nothing

`select_costed` (reclaim.rs:1185) ranks candidates by

```rust
(!candidate.idle, class, cost, u64::MAX - candidate.seq)
```

`idle` is the **primary** key, ahead of the footprint class. So an **idle
process holding zero pages** (footprint `Some(0)` → class 1) sorts ahead of a
**running process holding enough to cover the head outright** (class 0). D6's
stated intent is "prefer idle *holders*"; the code never requires the candidate
to hold anything.

The consequence is a closed cycle. The selected zero-page victim honors the
park, freezes its pipeline, and `prepare_suspend` finds its working sets map to
**no page locations at all** → `NothingReclaimable` → `suspend_at_safe_point`
returns `Ok(false)` → the `ParkGuard` declines the park and resumes the
pipeline → the process is `Running` again and **immediately re-eligible**. It
is picked again on the next escalation, forever.

### How this was pinned down

`private_resident_pages` was instrumented to print, on every empty result, how
many of the victim's target pages were excluded for being shared with another
working set, held by a cache root, or already swapped — gated on
`target_pages > 0`. In a run that reached `nothing_reclaimable = 204,859`, that
print fired **zero times**. Since `NothingReclaimable` is returned only when the
private set is empty, every one of those 204,859 victims had
`target_pages == 0`: they were not holding pages that turned out to be shared,
they were **holding nothing to begin with**.

The three unit tests in §5 demonstrate the selection rule and the two
zero-page follow-on hazards directly, with no runtime needed.

## 4. Why "shared pages" is NOT the explanation

An earlier reading of this file blamed KV-trie sharing: greedy decoding
(`temperature = 0.0`, `ignore_eos = true`, common instruction) makes sequences
converge, the trie deduplicates their tails, and no page stays private. The
`target_pages == 0` result above rules that out as the mechanism — the victims
never held pages in the first place. The paragraphs below are retained only
because the exclusion logic is still worth understanding when reasoning about
the fix.

### The exclusion rule

`PageTable::private_resident_pages` (page_table.rs:1585) returns only pages
that are (a) reachable from the victim's working sets, (b) **not** reachable
from any other working set, (c) **not** anchored by a cache root, and (d)
resident rather than swapped. A page shared with anything else is excluded.

Two structural weaknesses remain worth noting for the fix, even though neither
is what wedged this run:

- **Nothing learns.** A victim that declines with `NothingReclaimable` is
  returned to `Running` unchanged, so the very next escalation may pick it
  again. There is no memory, no backoff, and no exclusion — which is what turns
  a bad pick into an unbounded spin rather than a single wasted cycle.
- **Two different notions of "what this victim is worth".** Selection scores
  candidates with `KvStore::exclusive_footprint`; the suspend path decides with
  `PageTable::private_resident_pages`. Nothing keeps them consistent, so
  selection can rate a candidate attractive that the suspend path then rejects.

### A separate wedge found on the way

Re-running the same configuration with divergent sampling
(`--temperature 1.0 --top-p 0.95`) never reached KV allocation at all — zero
contention-trace lines — because the scheduler stalled with
`in_flight_launches: batch of 2 (settled=false, age=160s)` and
`pending_binds=256`. That is an independent defect on the sampling path and
needs its own investigation; it is not the livelock described here.

## 5. The three selection defects, as unit tests

Each is demonstrated by a new test in `store::reclaim::tests`. All three pass,
i.e. all three behaviours are present. The first is the root cause above; the
other two are the follow-on hazards a zero-page victim would trigger:

1. **`diag_idle_zero_footprint_beats_a_covering_running_holder`** —
   `select_costed` sorts on `(!idle, class, cost, …)`, so `idle` outranks the
   footprint class. An idle process holding **nothing** is selected over a
   running process whose suspension would cover the head's demand outright.
   D6's stated intent is "prefer idle *holders*"; the code does not require the
   candidate to hold anything.
2. **`diag_zero_page_suspend_is_granted_a_restore_immediately`** —
   `report_suspended(pid, 0)` enqueues a restore demanding 0 pages, which the
   drain finishes on sight, returning the process to `Running` and making it
   instantly re-selectable.
3. **`diag_zero_page_suspend_resets_the_head_progress_deadline`** —
   `report_suspended` clears `inner.progress` unconditionally, so a suspension
   that freed nothing still buys the head a fresh 10-second deadline window.

(2) and (3) are not reachable from production today, because `yield_point_at`
returns early when the working-set list is empty. They remain live API hazards.

## 6. Proposed redesign

**Status: E3 (§6.3) is implemented and verified; the rest is proposal and has
not been signed off.**

### 6.1 The criterion

What failed here was a *performance* heuristic — D6's cost ordering, with `idle`
as the primary sort key — carrying *liveness*. When it chose wrong the system
did not get slower, it **stopped**. So the test any replacement must pass:

> Liveness must never depend on a heuristic. A heuristic may decide **which**
> victim is cheaper; it must never decide **whether** progress happens.

Everything below is organised around that separation: exact mechanisms hold
liveness and have no tuning knobs; heuristics are quarantined where being wrong
only costs throughput.

### 6.2 The shift

Today the subsystem answers **"who should yield right now?"**, recomputed from
scratch on every event, by every waiter. That question is *stateless*, so there
is nowhere to attach feedback — which is exactly why a declined victim leaves no
trace and is re-picked forever.

Instead, maintain **"what should the resident set be?"** as durable state. Three
things become possible that are impossible today:

| today | after |
|---|---|
| no object to ask "is the current allocation feasible?" | a checkable invariant |
| nowhere to record a refusal | reclaimability is state, so feedback has a home |
| cannot conclude "this rung is exhausted" | a computable predicate |

This is **scheduling, not admission**: it never decides who may *start* (that
stays with M5/Vesuvius), only who is *resident*. It therefore sits inside the
standing directive, and it is what the stated target — "match ideal admission
control WITHOUT admission" — actually requires.

### 6.3 Exact mechanisms — liveness lives here, no knobs

**E1. Explicit `RESIDENT` / `EVICTED` partition**, maintained rather than
recomputed, over **current** footprint:

```
Σ_{p ∈ RESIDENT} current_footprint(p) ≤ pool_capacity
```

Exact and self-maintaining: exceed it and something is evicted. (See §6.5 — an
earlier sketch said *projected* footprint, which smuggles a prediction into the
foundation of the invariant.)

**E2. Reclaimability is a state, invalidated by events — not timers.**

```rust
enum Reclaimability {
    Eligible { pages: u32 },
    Ineligible { reason: IneligibleReason },
}
enum IneligibleReason {
    HoldsNothing,      // cleared by an ALLOCATION event
    Pinned,            // cleared when this process's fires drain
    NoProgressYet,     // cleared by completing one fire (E6)
    CopyFailed,        // backoff — the one irreducible timer (H3)
}
```

`HoldsNothing` is not a guess, it is a **logical fact**: a process holding
nothing has nothing to yield, and cannot acquire anything by waiting — only by
allocating. So it leaves the candidate set until its allocation changes, and the
livelock becomes **impossible by construction** rather than unlikely. This is
the same move as D2's "the safe point is a state, not a place", applied to
suitability.

**E3. One definition of "reclaimable".** Delete `exclusive_footprint` as a
*selection* input; the planner asks the same `reclaim_quote` the suspend path
will answer, which returns a typed reason when it returns zero — feeding E2.
Pure de-duplication: with one implementation, drift is impossible.

**E4. Rung exhaustion as a computable predicate.** Rung 0 (reclaim unreferenced)
→ 1 (evict) → **2 (shrink the head's demand: partial/chunked grant)** → 3 (kill).
Escalation is driven by *"no feasible plan exists"*, not by a 10-second clock;
the deadline demotes to a bug watchdog. Rung 2 is new and matters: today an
oversized head has no option between "wait" and "kill somebody".

**E5. A single-owner planner** replaces per-waiter `escalate()`: compute an
eviction set covering the **whole deficit**, commit it, observe each step. Plan
size is exactly the deficit — no constant. Also collapses O(waiters × candidates)
footprint probing under the global KV lock to O(candidates).

**E6. Eviction requires prior progress.** A process promoted into `RESIDENT` is
not evictable until it has completed **one fire**. Not a duration — an event.
This bounds swap cost to at most one round trip per unit of work done, which is
provable rather than tuned, and it removes the forced rotation described next.

**E7. Refusal accounting, and the liveness assertion.** Every planner decision
emits deficit, plan size, per-step outcome, per-candidate refusal reason. Assert
continuously:

> `deficit > 0` with zero completed plan steps over N rounds is a **bug**, not a
> workload.

Any N works — it is a detector, not a policy. This is the invariant a mock-pool
unit test can hold, and it is what would have caught this defect.

Note E6 also fixes a structural forcing function: `enqueue_restore` currently
re-inserts a restore at the process's **original spawn seq**, so an old suspended
process always outranks a younger resident's allocation. Service order stays
spawn-clock FCFS (starvation-freedom preserved) — E6 only bounds how often the
residency may change.

### 6.4 Quarantined heuristics — performance only

**H1. Which covering subset to evict.** Irreducible, but it becomes a single
objective (minimise bytes moved subject to covering the deficit — a subset-sum,
with a known-bounded greedy on freed/moved ratio) instead of a pile of
tie-breaking rules.

**H2. Swap vs recompute.** Needs a cost model, so it is frankly a heuristic, and
the estimates are envelope-grade (~4–16 ms re-prefill vs ~6–20 ms for a 122 MiB
swap round trip). **Weakest item; independent of the rest; defer it** until
measurement shows it is needed. Its motivation is real, though: host swap is the
*only* eviction mechanism today, so `swap_pool_size = 0` disarms the ladder
entirely (§10.1).

**H3. `CopyFailed` backoff.** A transport retry policy — irreducible, and this is
the right place for it.

**The property that makes the design defensible:** if H1–H3 are all maximally
wrong, the system gets **slower**; it does not wedge. E2/E4/E7 hold liveness.
The current design has the opposite shape — one wrong performance heuristic put
the GPU at 0% for 82 seconds.

### 6.5 Two corrections to an earlier sketch

Recorded because both were knobs sitting in the liveness path, which is the very
thing this redesign exists to remove:

- **Residency tenure was first written as a minimum time quantum.** A duration is
  a tuning knob, and its size would have interacted with the D4 deadline. The
  exact statement is event-based (E6: one fire).
- **The feasibility invariant first used *projected* footprint.** Future KV need
  depends on how many tokens a process will generate, so that is a prediction —
  a heuristic at the root of the invariant. Current footprint is exact (E1).

### 6.6 What is kept

Not a rewrite of everything — these were sound under investigation: RAII grants
(`Drop` = rollback, no leaks observed); D2 safe-point-as-state and
`wait_yielding` racing the park signal (including the lost-wakeup guard in
`fire::acquire_grant`); D3 requester/victim unification; one queue with
head-first-claim as **service order**; kill via `process::terminate`
(quiesce-first, never a signal); and the `PoolPort` physics/policy split — E3's
quote *extends* that port rather than bypassing it.

### 6.7 Migration order

A second from-scratch rewrite is what produced this defect, so: smallest first,
each step independently testable.

1. **E3** — `reclaim_quote` + typed zero-reasons. Kills the two-definitions
   problem and the measured livelock.
2. **E2** — reclaimability state. Makes the livelock impossible by construction.
3. **E5** planner → 4. **E6** progress-gated eviction → 5. **E4** rung 2 + D7
   re-targeting → 6. **H2** recompute, only if measured to be worth it.

Steps 1–2 are small and close the measured bug. **E2 is the real defence**:
patching the sort key alone revives this workload but leaves the open-loop
controller intact, so the next reason a bad candidate gets picked reproduces the
livelock.

### 6.8 Open risks

- **E5's planner is a new serialization point.** That is engineering debt, not
  elegance, and it is only repaid by keeping `reclaim_quote` batching *outside*
  the global KV lock. If that slips, it becomes a different bottleneck.
- **E1 adds a state axis orthogonal to `ProcState`'s five states**, so the
  product space grows. Confirm the two axes are genuinely independent — each
  closed under its own single transition function — or this is a regression in
  clarity rather than an improvement.
- **H2's cost ordering is too close to call from arithmetic.** Measure before
  building on it.

## 7. Coverage gap

Nothing in the suite reaches this shape. `runtime/engine/tests/contention.rs`
spawns a **fixed fleet of 8** lanes against a 4-page pool — every lane holds
pages by construction, so the "victim holds nothing" case never arises. The
livelock needs sustained oversubscription *and* at least one idle, zero-page
process sitting in the candidate set. Test 1 in §5 reproduces the selection
rule deterministically and is the natural regression guard.

## 8. Instrumentation added for this investigation

Currently in the working tree, **not committed**, and gated so it is inert by
default:

- `ContentionStats` / `ContentionDiagnostics`: `escalate_no_candidates`,
  `escalate_posted`, `nothing_reclaimable`, a five-way `proc_states` histogram,
  and `eligible_victims` (how many candidates `escalate` may legally draw from).
- `ContentionOrchestrator::record_nothing_reclaimable`, called from the
  previously-silent `NothingReclaimable` early return in
  `inferlet/process/preemption.rs`.
- `bootstrap.rs`: a sampler behind `PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS=<ms>` that prints
  one line per tick while anything is queued. It uses `println!`, not
  `tracing` — the embedded pyo3 server boots with `skip_tracing: true` and
  installs no subscriber, so a `tracing` event there goes nowhere. (That is
  itself worth fixing: the embedded server currently emits no structured logs
  at all.)

Decide separately whether the three counters and the sampler are worth keeping;
the `NothingReclaimable` counter at minimum should stay, since its absence is
what made this invisible.

## 9. Reproduction

```bash
cd benches   # patched harness: ~/Workspace/pie-wt/vllm-compare-records/pie_bench_cap.py
             # (adds --total-pages / --swap-pool-size passthrough; the shipped
             #  harness cannot express a real KV cap)
STAGE=<dir with Pie.toml + target/wasm32-wasip2/release/text_completion_bench.wasm>

# livelocks within ~6 s; GPU drops to 0% and stays there
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PIE_BENCH_INFERLET_DIR=$STAGE PYTHONPATH=. \
  PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS=500 \
  uv --project ../sdk/python-server run python .../pie_bench_cap.py tput \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --num-requests 256 --concurrency 128 --max-tokens 512 \
  --warmup 2 --driver cuda_native --device cuda:0 \
  --total-pages 2151 --swap-pool-size 4096 --request-timeout 90

# clean, for contrast (concurrency == resident capacity; contention never engages)
#   ... --concurrency 61 ...
```

## 10. Configuration traps found along the way

1. **`swap_pool_size` defaults to 0, which disarms suspend/restore entirely.**
   `kv_swap_capable` is derived from the driver's advertised KV copy mask; with
   no host swap pool the ladder degrades to pool-only reclaim. Same cap, same
   oversubscription, 128 requests: `0` → 57/128 completed; `4096` → 128/128.
   The mechanism this subsystem is built around is **off by default**.
2. **`--kv-pages` is dead for `cuda_native`** — never placed in
   `driver_options`, so it silently does nothing. Wire it or reject it.
3. **`--gpu-mem-util` does not cap KV residency** — it sizes only the CUDA
   memory planner's *logical* budget (`logical_kv_pages` / `kv_tokens`); the
   runtime exceeds it freely. The only binding knob is the driver option
   `total_pages`, which the shipped harness does not expose. **Any pie
   benchmark that believed it created KV pressure with `--gpu-mem-util` or
   `--kv-pages` did not.**

## 11. Loose ends (unrelated to the livelock)

- **A documented rule nothing enforces.** `DevGeo::has_mask` and
  `BoundForwardPass::dense_mask` both record that a fire carrying a dense
  device mask must be scheduled SOLO. Both are computed at bind and never read.
  Wire the rule or drop the claim.
- **`RegisteredProgram::pricing`** is computed on every program registration
  and has no consumer.
- **Pre-existing flake**: `scheduler::worker::tests::pipeline_close_drains_the_already_submitted_run_ahead_tail`
  fails roughly 1 run in 4 with "driver published RETRY at frame settle".
- **Docs/SDK drift**: `website/docs/reference/configuration.mdx` documents
  `[model.scheduler]` keys absent from the Rust schema (`batch_policy`,
  `default_endowment_pages`, `admission_oversubscription_factor`) and cites a
  path that does not exist (`runtime/src/inference/adaptive_policy.rs`); the
  Python SDK still carries `speculation_depth`, absent from the Rust
  `SchedulerConfig`, which would hard-fail `deny_unknown_fields` parsing.

## 12. Root cause #3 — sealed frame ⇄ copy barrier ⇄ pool resize deadlock

### 12.1 The frozen state (seal-fix verification run, sample ~36 onward)

With fixes 1 and 2 in place the run reaches 89/256 and then freezes hard for
the remaining ~70 s. The scheduler dump at the freeze:

```
pending (80):
  Launch fire 75077 …            <- sealed-frame member
  Launch fire 75078 …            <- sealed-frame member
  ResizePool                     <- position 3
  Launch fire 75080 … 75126      <- ~47 more sealed-frame members
  CopyKvTracked  x4              <- suspend D2H / restore H2D
  Launch fire 75127 … 75142      <- ~16 sealed-frame members BEHIND the copies
  CopyKvTracked  x4  (interleaved)

```

Everything is idle — no launch in flight, no control in flight — yet a fully
sealed 65-fire frame never posts, 8 queued copies never dispatch, and a
ResizePool sits at queue position 3 forever.

### 12.2 The cycle

Three ordering rules, each locally sound:

- **R1 (frame atomicity)** — a sealed frame posts WHOLE; its fires dispatch by
  id, not queue position (`frame.rs plan_dispatch`).
- **R2 (copy barrier)** — a stamped fire queued *behind* a standalone copy
  (`CopyKv`/`CopyKvTracked`/`CopyState`) puts its lane in `blocked_lanes`, and
  a sealed frame holds while `members ∩ blocked_lanes ≠ ∅`
  (`worker.rs` queue scan, `barrier_seen`; `frame.rs:735-744`).
- **R3 (resize ordering)** — `rotate_launch_for_wave_work` refuses to rotate
  front launches past a `ResizePool` (it is not `standalone_copy`, not
  `lifecycle_control`, not `PreLaunchCopy`), because "pool resizes order
  against queued launches". The rotation scan looks at exactly ONE item — the
  first non-Launch behind the front — and gives up.

Composed, with a sealed frame straddling the {resize, copies} pair:

1. Frame F holds: ~16 of its 65 fires (75127+) sit behind the copies, so their
   lanes are in `blocked_lanes` → `plan_dispatch` returns `Hold(500µs)`
   forever, until the copies retire.
2. The copies never dispatch: the ready-item loop only acts on the queue
   FRONT. The front is Launch 75077 (a member of F); rotation is refused
   because the first non-Launch item is the ResizePool. `break`. The copies at
   position ~50 are unreachable.
3. The ResizePool never reaches the front: 75077/75078 leave the queue only by
   posting as part of F. Cycle: **F → copies → (queue reachability) resize →
   F**.

The deadlock also strangles the reclaim ladder itself: `quiesce=7` — seven
victims stuck Quiescing because their queued fires are sealed into F and can
never settle — so no pages free (`free=0`), the 45 waiters starve, and the
head (needing exactly **1 page**) never advances. GPU 0%.

Only contention creates this shape: suspend/restore inject standalone copies
and pool resizes into the middle of a live generation's queue ("a resize per
reclaim step"). Uncontended runs do copies/resizes at generation boundaries
where no sealed frame straddles them.

### 12.3 The internal contradiction

`worker.rs` states both of these, ~540 lines apart:

- `standalone_copy` doc (line ~2830): "These touch pages no queued fire
  references (suspend takes only unpinned drained pages; restore writes
  freshly reserved ones), so **a held wave must NEVER starve them** — the
  preemption ladder is what unsticks a held wave in the first place."
- Queue-scan comment (line ~3370): "A queued ASYNC control (standalone copy…)
  is a launch barrier: a fire enqueued behind it must not post until it
  retires."

The first comment is the design intent and is *correct*: grants pin every page
a queued copy touches, so no queued fire references them. The dispatch code
implements neither half — it starves the copies (they are only reachable via
front rotation, which R3 vetoes) *and* it barriers unrelated fires on them.

### 12.4 The fix (implemented 2026-07-25)

Safety precondition, verified in code first: **no queued fire can reference a
queued standalone copy's pages.** A suspend copies working sets whose fires
were purged at leave; a restored process is only woken after its H2D copy
retired (`preemption.rs::restore_from_park` awaits the tracked completion
before `resume_pipeline`). Grants pin every page a queued copy touches, a
shrink cannot trim granted pages, and no two queued copies can alias (a
restore's pages are only granted after the suspend that freed them retired).

Three changes in `scheduler/worker.rs`, no knobs:

1. **Barrier removed (edge 1).** `CopyKv`/`CopyKvTracked`/`CopyState` no
   longer set `barrier_seen`; the whole `barrier_seen` mechanism is gone.
   `blocked_lanes` now comes only from `PreLaunchCopy` (order-coupled to its
   consumer by construction). Same precedent as `ResizePool`'s earlier
   exemption (~45x). The queue pass is extracted as a testable
   `scan_queue()`.
2. **Out-of-band copy dispatch (edge 2).** `dispatch_ready_items` ends with a
   sweep: control slot free → the first standalone copy dispatches from ANY
   queue position. The queue front can be legitimately immovable (a gathering
   frame, a resize waiting out the pipe); the copies must never wait on it.
3. **Settling copies no longer hold frame posting.**
   `PendingControl.holds_launches`: true for `PreLaunchCopy` (consumer
   coupling) and pool resizes (pipe drain), false for standalone copies — so
   frames keep posting while suspend/restore traffic settles, removing the
   ~25%-of-wall serialization the single control slot would otherwise impose
   under churn (d2h+h2d ≈ 24 s per 90 s run).

Regression tests:
`standalone_copy_dispatches_out_of_band_past_an_immovable_front` (the exact
frozen shape), `queued_standalone_copies_and_resizes_never_block_lanes`,
`a_settling_standalone_copy_does_not_hold_frame_posting`. Engine lib suite
368/368 green.

### 12.5 Verification (5 runs, 256 req / conc 128 / 2,151 pages)

| run | completed | wall | tok/s |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|
| fix3   | 256/256 | 14.4 s | 9,090 |
| rerun  | 109/256 | 90 s timeout | 620 |
| rep1   | 256/256 | 16.4 s | 7,999 |
| rep2   | 256/256 | 16.4 s | 7,998 |
| rep3   | 256/256 | 15.7 s | 8,345 |

Reference: ideal admission (M1, concurrency 61 = resident capacity, contention
never engages) is 256/256 at 9,949 tok/s. The best fixed run reaches **0.91x
of that with no admission control**; typical runs 0.80x. GPU utilization
during completing runs: 79% overall, 90% when busy (was 0% for 82/82 samples
in the livelock). The old M3 (same config, pre-fix): 34/256 at 193 tok/s —
a 47x throughput recovery.

**The deadlock is gone in every run** — counters never freeze, `kills=0`,
`nothing_reclaimable=0`, quiesce always drains. The one failing run is a
different regime: **thrash**. Its trace shows 900 suspend/restore cycles
(vs ~300 in a completing run), ~55 GB of PCIe traffic, cumulative copy time
180 s in a 90 s wall — the reclaim ladder oscillates instead of holding a
stable resident set, and requests miss the 90 s per-request timeout. Counters
move throughout; it is not a liveness failure.

That regime is precisely what §6's unimplemented remainder targets: per-event
"who yields?" selection has no memory and no plan, so once the uniform decode
waves desynchronize, eviction choices oscillate. The fix belongs to E1/E2/E4
(resident-set planning, reclaimability as state, hysteresis via the progress
deadline), not to the dispatch layer — the dispatch layer now provably does
what the policy asks of it.

## 13. Roomy regression — the rewrite costs −17% with contention idle (2026-07-25)

Prompted by the operator's observation that pie should not trail vLLM without
KV pressure. Confirmed by a four-round bisect over the unsquashed lineage
(engine rebuilt per commit in the `kilimanjaro-baseline` worktree; identical
harness, roomy 256 req / conc 128 / util 0.90):

| commit | tok/s | avg batch | pipeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 88bf1e38f (pre-rewrite tip) | 17,240 | 13.8 ms | 2-deep overlap |
| B1 `681a47f3b` burn dead code | 17,695 | 13.4 ms | overlap — clean |
| **B2 `29d0b190e` no off switch** | **14,607** | **7.7 ms** | **serial — the break** |
| B4 `285394b3a` | 14,527 | 7.7 ms | serial |
| B6 `d52dc0d5f` | 14,129 | 7.7 ms | serial |
| HEAD + this session's fixes | 14,178 | 7.7 ms | serial |

Reference: vLLM 17,187 @conc128, 19,376 @512req/conc256; pre-rewrite pie is
**parity on both shapes** (17,240 / 19,397). Post-B2 pie is 0.825x.

**Mechanism.** Pre-B2, a run without `PIE_KV_CONTENTION` had no orchestrator:
`contention()` returned `None`, gates no-op'd, and a fire's KV demand took the
legacy direct-allocation path. B2 (by directive: no mode, no off switch)
installs the orchestrator always and routes **every fire's KV demand through
the grant path** — a global `with_inner` mutex plus FCFS bookkeeping per fire,
128 lanes per step. That pushed the boundary gather (~guest resubmit → seal)
from just under the 7.4 ms execute window to ~9.0 ms, so the frame N+1 seal
now lands after frame N retires: the Venus run-ahead overlap (depth 2)
collapsed to serial posting with a 1.4 ms exposed gap. The avg-batch-latency
signature (13.8 ms in-flight with 7.4 ms steps → 7.7 ms in-flight with 9.0 ms
steps) is decisive.

**The directive is not the defect; the implementation is.** Always-on
semantics does not require paying queue bookkeeping when nobody is waiting.

**Fix direction (no knob, unchanged semantics):** an uncontended fast path in
grant acquisition — one atomic summary check (free pages cover the demand ∧ no
waiters ∧ no parks) takes pages directly and skips the queue; any failure
falls into the existing FCFS path. The futex pattern: uncontended = one CAS,
contended = queue. Expected recovery: ~17.2–17.7k @conc128 (vLLM parity), and
it lifts every contended number too — the M1 "ideal ceiling" (9,949) itself
pays this tax, so the §12.5 ratios understate the fixed engine.

Open question: Stage V recorded a roomy A/B floor of ≥0.982x vs the
pre-rewrite baseline — that measurement cannot have covered this
configuration and needs a post-mortem.

## 14. Rainer v1 — implementation record (2026-07-25, evening)

The rainer.md design landed in one shot: legacy retired wholesale, new
implementation upfront, verification deferred (operator directive).

**New:** `src/planner.rs` (ResidencyPlanner: FCFS registry, one BTreeMap
queue over spawn seq, planner-level head-first accumulation, eviction
planning, hog + starvation predicates, diagnostics), `src/planner/grant.rs`
(Demand/AllocationGrant RAII, carried over), `src/planner/exec.rs` (evict:
fence → leave(Close) → detachable drain → lease quiesce → prepare → D2H →
commit; restore: prepare → H2D → commit → unfence, bounded transport
retries then fail-loud terminate), `src/inferlet/process/gate.rs`
(residency gate: one atomic load when everyone is resident; drains own
pending fires then parks when evicted), `src/inferlet/process/teardown.rs`
(defer_resource_teardown, moved verbatim from preemption.rs).

**Deleted (~4,000 lines):** store/reclaim.rs + reclaim/{grant,queue,state},
inferlet/process/preemption.rs (safe points, yield_point at 23 prologues,
wait_yielding, ParkGuard, serialize_under_contention, restore_from_park),
the 5-state ProcState machine, the per-fire orchestrator gate, the progress
deadline + D7 kill rung, PIE_KV_EXHAUSTION_MS, the bootstrap
leave/kill/probe hook seams, and the scheduler's freeze/resume machinery
(FreezePipeline/ResumePipeline items, frozen_pipelines set,
LeaveKind::Suspend — all had become dead).

**Key mechanisms vs the design (deltas):**
- The fire hot path keeps the existing demand→acquire→prepare loop shape;
  `acquire` fast path = two free-list pops gated on two atomic loads
  (waiters == 0 && nonresident == 0). No plan-time batched frame grant in
  v1 — the planner is event-driven (parks/frees/transfer landings), which
  is boundary planning with lookahead 0; the K-frame delta lookahead of
  rainer.md §2 is a follow-up optimization, not a structural change.
- The suspend seal is the working-set FIRE LEASE promoted to a Dekker pair
  with a new per-lifecycle `suspend_fence` atomic (store/kv/working_set.rs):
  fires take the lease after any park and before prepare and hold it
  through finalize; the evictor fences, drains detachably, then awaits
  lease quiescence (event-driven Notify) before prepare_suspend. This is
  the exact no-torn-copy guarantee the old design got from victim-side
  self-suspend.
- Restore demand is re-read from the store (swapped count) at serve time;
  restores are accumulation-gated, oldest evictee first.
- The old D7 deadline kill is replaced by TWO computed predicates: Hog
  (head.held + head.need > total → fail the head) and Starved (eviction
  cannot fund + no transfer in flight + zero fire leases fleet-wide → fail
  the YOUNGEST parked ask). No timers anywhere.
- tests/contention.rs and tests/contention_host_full.rs ported to planner
  diagnostics; host_full now asserts starvations_total (no kill exists).

**State:** engine lib + all targets compile; 340/340 lib tests green;
pie-server-py green. NOT yet run: contention e2e pair, pressure bench
(256-req 5/5), roomy A/B vs vLLM parity (the B2-toll recovery this design
exists to prove). Known deliberate gaps: no grow rung (logical capacity is
fixed; elastic VMM trim is physical-only today), device-geometry fires are
non-detachable so a victim with a pending device-geom op is skipped, and a
process idle in a host await holding pages is treated as evictable only
via D2H (never killed).

### 14.1 Bench round 1 — eviction-leave wedge (found and fixed)

First contended run (128req/c128 @2151 pages): 0/128, planner trace frozen
for 300 s at `evicting=1` — a NEW deadlock, introduced by v1's eviction
leave. `exec::evict` posted `LeaveKind::Close` with `lane = pid`, but Close
is LANE-keyed and the frame policy's lanes are keyed by pipeline-scope id —
the leave matched nothing, the victim's silent lane stayed awaited, the
next boundary never sealed, and the second eviction's drain waited forever
on a completion inside that unsealable frame. (The old ladder never hit
this: its Suspend leave ran `on_process_leave`, and its victims drained
themselves BEFORE leaving.)

Fix: reintroduced `LeaveKind::Suspend` with new no-purge semantics —
`FramePolicy::on_process_suspend(owner)` clears `awaited` on every lane the
victim owns while keeping already-submitted frames sealable (the graceful
pipeline-close shape, process-wide), so the tail drains and releases the
leases the eviction quiesces on. Purging instead would orphan the queued
fires WITH their leases. Also hardened the eviction drain with
`try_finalize_guard`: never wait out the guest's own finalize gate (held
across unbounded channel awaits) — abort the attempt and re-plan.

### 14.2 Bench rounds 2-3 — two pre-existing completion-wakeup bugs, exposed

The remaining contended freezes (evicting=1 stuck at the eviction drain,
scheduler empty) came down to two latent engine defects around
`WorkItemCompletion`, both predating Rainer:

1. **The resolve doorbell could be filtered.** `resolve_success/failure`
   rang the waker with `publish(slot, 1)`. If the driver had already
   published a HIGHER per-fire epoch to that slot (its terminal notify) and
   the waiter re-registered after observing it, the monotonic epoch filter
   dropped the `publish(1)` as stale — the waiter slept forever on a
   settled fire. Fixed: resolve now uses the unconditional `wake(slot)`
   (the resolution lives in an atomic outside the epoch machinery).
   This window (driver-notify → worker-retire) is exactly where the
   pre-existing `pipeline_close_drains` RETRY flake (#10) and possibly the
   --temperature 1.0 wedge (#15) lived.

2. **The waker table parks ONE waker per slot** (`state.waker.replace`).
   The codebase's implicit invariant was one awaiter per fire completion,
   enforced by convention: every op-await ran on the owning guest's task
   (or under the pipeline finalize gate). Rainer's eviction drain broke the
   convention — it awaited an unsettled op's completion while the guest
   could await the same completion from `drain_rs_predecessors` (which
   takes no gate); the second registration overwrote the first waker and
   whichever task lost slept forever. Fixed structurally: the planner
   never awaits a fire completion — the eviction drain finalizes SETTLED
   detachable ops only (their poll never registers), and lease quiescence
   (a tokio Notify, multi-waiter safe) is the eviction's only wait.

Also in these rounds: the Yield-at-acquire mechanism (14.1's successor) —
marking a victim Evicting wakes its parked asks with `Acquired::Yield`; the
fire path settles the victim's own tail (the only task that can finalize
device-geometry ops) and waits out the eviction. The rollback-spin from
14.1 (10,969 rollbacks/run) is gone: rollbacks now occur only on real
prepare/copy failures.

Residual (mock 4-page torture geometry, ~2/12): a lane wait-set hole
(awaited lane, no frames, no leave — same family as 14.1) and a starvation
misfire under total swap exhaustion. Both need the GPU-geometry bench
verdict to prioritize.

### 14.3 Bench rounds 4-5 — liveness closed; the remaining gap is gather serialization

With the 14.2 fixes plus the serve CASCADE (the old drain's
younger-from-surplus rule, restored: a served head no longer blocks the
next unmet ask from absorbing remaining free pages), the GPU verdict
(RTX 4090, Qwen3-0.6B, 2026-07-25 late):

- **Roomy: fully recovered.** 256req/c128: 17,236–17,283 tok/s across four
  runs (vLLM 17,187; pre-rewrite pie 17,240; pre-Rainer 14,178 — the B2
  −17% toll is gone). 512req/c256: 19,402 (vLLM 19,376; pie-base 19,397).
- **Contended h2h (128req/c128 @34,416 tok matched): 128/128 in 6/6 runs**,
  5.5–6.7 K tok/s vs vLLM 13,939 (fresh confirm) — 0.42–0.48x.
- **Pressure (256req/c128, same cap + 90 s request timeout): 256/256 in
  6/6 completed runs** at 4.5–5.8 K tok/s (one early 75/256 run was
  pre-cascade). No thrash signature anywhere: d2h/h2d page counts stay
  symmetric, evict/restore cycles are bounded, no oscillation.

Bottleneck attribution (measured, not guessed): the cascade cut parks per
h2h run from 1,563 to ~68 — and throughput did NOT move, so park round
trips are NOT the gap. The batch histogram is: 852 batches, avg ~77 rows,
6.87 ms/batch = 5.85 s of execution in an 11.1 s wall — **47% of the run
is inter-batch gap**. Under pressure the fleet's ~4 pages/frame of fresh
demand is funded reactively (evictions land only after asks park), so the
gather serializes behind execution instead of overlapping (the same
run-ahead collapse shape as the B2 regression, now caused by page supply
latency instead of a grant gate). The elder-of-head fast-path bypass did
not help because under this workload the head is an early evictee's
restore — almost every resident is younger.

The structural answer is rainer.md §2/§10-step-2 as designed: a residency
ledger with per-lane positions, K-frame delta lookahead, and plan-time
batched grants at the boundary, so page supply is staged BEFORE the demand
arrives and the gather never waits. That is the next phase; the reactive
v1 is liveness-complete and roomy-clean.

### 14.4 Final round-4 tally and the two residual defects

Round 4 (elder bypass — no measurable effect, see 14.3): roomy 17,246;
h2h 128/128 x3 (5.5-6.7K); pressure 4/5 complete (4.5-5.2K), one 77/256
run frozen at evicting=1. Rounds 3+4 combined: h2h 8/8 complete,
pressure 9/10.

The frozen run's trace shows the two remaining defects precisely:
1. **Evict/restore ping-pong (E6 regression):** one pid cycled
   evict(9p) → restore(9p) back-to-back for seconds (3.9 s of H2D in a
   ~40 s window). v1 dropped the old design's E6 rule — a restored
   process must make progress (one fire) before it is evictable again.
2. **A rare evict stall between "quiesced; preparing" and the D2H post**
   (all-sync code — no marker, no panic-watcher output), alongside
   repeated "restore prepared" lines with no commit and
   restore_failures=0. ~1/10 pressure runs; same family as the mock
   e2e's residual y12 shape. Needs a live stack (ptrace_scope) or
   finer markers. Filed as #25.

## §15 Phase-2 probe: the contended gap is guest-turnaround serialization (2026-07-25)

Setup: E6 landed (Proc.progressed — no re-evict before the next acquire;
zero roomy cost) plus timestamped markers on one monotonic clock:
`PIE_FIRE_TIMING` wave records, planner park/serve/collect, exec step!,
and build-path markers (hp-enter at WIT arrival, hp-acquire at the
planner ask, rx-wake/rx-finalize in the take path).

E6 verification: roomy 17,141 (parity band); h2h unchanged (5.3–6.0K —
ping-pong was never the h2h bottleneck); restore→same-pid-re-evict now
min 26 ms / p50 283 ms (was back-to-back).

Measured anatomy of one h2h run (p2-h2h-1): 1,361 waves, avg 48.9 rows,
busy 5.93 s of 13.4 s span = **55.7% idle**, concentrated in ~306 gaps of
10–45 ms. Everything the planner does is fast and off the critical path:

- park→serve p50 = 0.0 ms (p90 12.3, p99 32) — accumulation + cascade work;
- serve→collect p50 = 0.3 ms — guest wakeup from the planner is prompt;
- evict chain p50: start→quiesced 0.5 ms, quiesced→D2H-post 0.3 ms,
  D2H-post→commit 4.4 ms; n=80. Quiescence is NOT the bottleneck.

The gap anatomy (p2-h2h-4, hp markers): after a contended wave completes,
the fleet's next fires arrive at the host **strictly serially, one guest
every 0.25–0.5 ms** (hp-enter drip), and the wait-all frame seals only
when the last lane fires-or-leaves: ~70 guests x ~0.4 ms ≈ the 30–40 ms
gap. hp-enter→hp-acquire is ~10 µs (the entire build preamble — settle
drain, wiring, demand calc — is innocent), and scheduler-side
enqueue/ready lags are ~0 (fire records). Baseline (uncontended) waves
show the same serial shape at ~0.12 ms/guest, hidden inside the 7 ms GPU
frame; roomy at ~58 µs/guest fits entirely. Contention multiplies the
per-guest serial cost ~3–8x and it becomes the critical path.

Suspects for the contended multiplier (all on the guest's WIT path only
when nonresident/waiters are nonzero): the residency-gate `is_resident`
planner-lock hit per call; the take path's inline finalizations
(KV lock) each poking `pages_freed` → an **inline `plan()` cascade on the
guest's own task**; `is_elder_of_head` + `note_progress` planner-lock
hits per acquire. The convoy hypothesis (rx-wake discriminator pending):
guests serialize behind the planner/KV locks while plan() churns.

Fix direction = E5 as designed (single-owner planner): plan() runs on ONE
dedicated task; every hot-path call site (parks, pages_freed pokes,
collects, executor callbacks) only *pokes* it. Guests never run the
drain. Fold note_progress into the elder check (one lock hit, not two).

Separate item: two deterministic-position silent stalls (~50 ms at ~2.3 s,
~317 ms at ~10.0 s; zero engine events; one D2H commit measured 311 ms /
157 ms in that window) — ~5% of idle, unexplained, possibly driver-side
(graph capture?). Not the main story.

### 15.1 E5 landed; the residual is a wake-herd lock storm (A/B-isolated)

E5 (single-owner drain task; hot paths only poke) + the idle-reclaim latch
+ E6-note folded into the elder check. Results, same h2h matrix:

- traced runs (PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS): **12,904 / 12,946 / 12,958 tok/s**
  = 0.93x vLLM (13,939). Idle 55.7% → **5.9%** (gaps >2 ms: 306/7.15 s →
  13/0.05 s). The deterministic ~317 ms silent stalls vanished too — they
  were D2H commits stuck behind the same lock convoy.
- untraced runs: **8,297–8,543** — consistently slower than traced.
- A/B isolation: PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS alone → 12,945 (fast regime);
  PIE_FIRE_TIMING alone → 8,407 (slow regime). The *guest-path probe
  printlns* create the fast regime: the stdout lock time-slices the wake
  herd, so the guests' KV/planner-lock critical sections stop colliding.

Regime anatomy (identical GPU cost per row ~89–90 µs in both): slow =
coherent herd, fat 77-row waves at ~9 ms cadence with a ~2 ms lock-storm
gap per wave (23% idle); fast = staggered arrivals, thin 48-row waves at
4.55 ms cadence, ~0 idle. Throughput is purely 1/(1+idle).

Shippable fixes attempted/planned, in order: (1) parking_lot for the two
storm locks (KvStore global + planner inner) — adaptive spinning instead
of futex round trips per handoff; (2) if insufficient, the structural cure
is rainer.md §2's boundary-batched grants: ONE task prepares the frame's
page allocations at the boundary instead of ~70 guests each taking the
global KV lock in their turnaround — which is also phase 2's remaining
component, so the herd fix and the design converge.

### 15.2 The lane-resurrection seal wedge (#25-B root cause) and its fix

parking_lot (15.1 fix 1) flipped untraced runs into the fast regime —
h2h 12,982, press 12,021 (256/256) — but 2 of 3 untraced h2h runs then
failed: one 300 s seal wedge (0/128) and one driver fail-stop. The wedge's
watchdog dump is unambiguous: 95 lanes awaited, 94 with complete frames,
and ONE lane `awaited=true queued_frames=0 front_complete=false` holding
the fleet's seal hostage — exactly the e2e-y12 shape filed in #25.

Root cause (static, confirmed by `record_arrival`): the victim's last
pre-fence fire can arrive at the worker AFTER the evictor's process-wide
Suspend leave was already processed. `record_arrival` recreates the lane
`awaited: true` (`or_insert_with`). The fire seals, executes, retires —
and the lane is now awaited with zero queued frames while its guest parks
in `wait_resident` with NO further leave posted: the Yield / lease-Fenced
/ residency-gate paths all violated the frame-policy contract ("any
guest-side wait that stops a lane's next fire MUST post a leave"). The
seal then waits forever; other victims' evictions cannot quiesce (queued
fires in the wedged frames hold their leases), so the whole engine
deadlocks. The faster de-cohered regime multiplied leave/rejoin churn and
took the race from ~1/10 pressure runs (#25) to ~2/3 h2h runs.

Fix: every `wait_resident` park site (acquire's Yield arm, both build
loops' lease-Fenced arms, copy_into's Fenced retry, the residency gate)
now re-posts the process-wide `LeaveKind::Suspend` leave first. The leave
is idempotent (`on_process_suspend` retains/clears), ordered after the
racing fire's arrival in the worker queue, and costs nothing outside
eviction paths. The probe printlns made the traced repro loop pass 4/4 —
the window sits exactly where the markers add jitter — so verification is
untraced (p5 round).

### 15.3 Phase-2 round verdict (final)

p5, untraced, wedge fix in: h2h 12,873 / 12,900 / 12,911 / 12,927 / 12,928
/ 13,013 — six for six 128/128, spread <1.1%, **0.925–0.933x vLLM**
(13,939; was 0.42x at §14.4). Pressure 11,677 / 11,923, both 256/256.
Roomy 17,156 (parity band). 340/340 lib tests (one 1/3 flake, 0/3 on
repeats), both contention integration tests green.

Scoreboard for the whole arc: reactive ladder 0/128 frozen → v1 liveness
fixes 5.5–6.7K → E5 + latch 8.3–8.5K (coherent herd) → + parking_lot
12.9K but 2/3 runs dead on the resurrection wedge → + leave fix: 12.9K,
9/9 clean. Remaining candidates: boundary batched grants (~7% + press
headroom, fatter waves at 58 µs/row), the one-off geometry fail-stop, and
a #15 retest (the wedge fix plausibly covers it).

## §16 Rainer v2 precondition probes — the projected upside mostly collapsed

Before prototyping v2 (rainer.md Part II), its two falsifiable
preconditions were measured (2026-07-25):

1. **Worker serial ingest** (the feared next bottleneck): the worker loop
   already carries a per-pass census (`worker_pass`, >2 ms passes,
   PIE_FIRE_TIMING). Result: ZERO >2 ms passes in fast-regime h2h, press,
   AND roomy with full 128-fire bursts. No hidden 1–3 ms monster; v2
   precondition (ii) passes trivially.
2. **KV-lock budget** (what boundary batching could amortize;
   PIE_KV_LOCK_TRACE, 1 µs threshold): h2h hold total 278.6 ms over a
   6.28 s span = **4.4% utilization** — nowhere near saturation. Roomy:
   0.3%. The pain is not hold volume but ONE long holder: tag `planner`
   holds 246.6 of those 278.6 ms (p50 1.4 µs, p99 483 µs — plan_eviction
   quoting EVERY candidate under a single hold), against which guests
   accumulate 3.9 s of aggregate wait (host-other 1.29 s +
   host-working-set 2.52 s). A convoy seeded by long holds, not a
   throughput-of-locking problem.
3. **Bonus — forced-coherent floor**: PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT=1 h2h runs
   **12,216** vs depth-2's 12,973 (−5.8%), with an essentially identical
   fat-wave histogram (~76 rows avg in both). The 35% regime cliff of
   §15.1 is CLOSED post-parking_lot; the current steady state is already
   fat/coherent, and run-ahead contributes ~6%.

Verdict: v2's two headline purchases — regime-cliff elimination and
lock-batching — are respectively already in hand and not worth buying
(4.4% utilization). v2 remains the right shape for the *seam class*
(membership push vs inference), but as a performance project it is
DEFERRED; the evidence points at one targeted fix instead: lazy
youngest-first chunked quoting in plan_eviction (stop at deficit
coverage), killing the 483 µs p99 planner hold. Landed same day;
p7 is the verification round.

p7 verdict (lazy quoting): h2h 12,811 / 12,988 / 13,029 — the p5 band
exactly; press 10,713 (press spreads 10.7–12.0K across rounds); roomy
17,187. No regression, no measurable gain — the long-hold convoy was not
the binding constraint either; the aggregate wait is many small handoffs,
and the residual ~7% is resident-set size + per-row overhead at ~76 rows.
Kept (bounded holds are strictly better hygiene). v2 DEFERRED as a
performance project — see rainer.md Part II status.

### 16.1 Hygiene pass (#26)

1. **Choke-point leave**: the process-wide Suspend re-leave moved INTO
   `wait_resident` (posted once, only when actually parking) — the five
   copy-pasted park-site blocks are deleted; every current and future
   park site is covered by construction.
2. `is_elder_of_head` renamed `note_ask_and_check_elder` — the E6
   side effect is now in the name and doc; `note_progress` takes a plain
   lock (no mirror recompute); the zero-demand path references the same
   event.
3. Drain-path test coverage: discovered already present — the two
   contention integration tests bootstrap inside a tokio runtime, so
   `arm_drain_task` fires and they exercise the ARMED async path (the
   inline fallback is only the planner-less unit-test world).
4. `re_arm_idle_reclaim()` — one semantic site for the exhaustion-latch
   clear (was scattered across three callers).
5. **KV taint guard**: parking_lot lost std's poisoning; `with_kv_lock`
   now sets a taint flag when a panic unwinds mid-operation and asserts
   it on every entry — fail-loud restored for half-mutated stores.

Verified: 340/340 lib + 2/2 integration; p8 bench h2h 12,908/12,907,
press 10,863 (256/256), roomy 17,215 — the p5/p7 band exactly.

## §16.2 Pre-commit cleanup pass (#27, 2026-07-25)

A four-angle review (reuse / simplification / efficiency / altitude — four
independent agents over the full uncommitted tree) followed by a fix pass.
Everything applied is behavior-preserving; the two hot-path items change
WHERE work happens, not what happens.

**Applied — structure**

- `settle_and_wait_resident` (fire.rs): the eviction back-off protocol
  (settle tails → wait out the eviction, §15.2 leave contract) had been
  hand-copied at three fire-submit sites (acquire_grant Yield, host build
  Fenced, device-geometry Fenced). One owner now; the sites are one-liners.
- `finalize_all` (fire.rs): the full FIFO finalize loop existed three times
  (residency gate, process teardown, forward-pass drop). One owner, with
  the teardown's log-and-continue policy as a parameter.
- Typed leave API (worker.rs): `notify_pipeline_leave(_owned)` overloaded
  its first id by kind — lane-scope for Close, process for Suspend /
  Terminate — the §15.2 seal-wedge key-space trap, re-enterable by any new
  caller. Replaced by `notify_lane_close(scope, owner)` /
  `notify_process_suspend(pid)` / `post_process_terminate(pid)` over one
  private poster; the key space is now fixed by the function name.
- `holds_launches` (worker.rs post_control): five per-arm literals whose
  values had to stay exactly complementary to `standalone_copy` (the §12
  deadlock class) are now computed from it.
- Unfence moved into `report_restored` (planner.rs): "restored ⇒ unfenced"
  was enforced by remembering to call a local closure before each of the
  restore executor's three success exits; a forgotten call would be a
  silent Resident-but-fenced per-process wedge. The planner's report path
  owns it now; failure paths keep fences up by not reporting.
- `Inner::unmet_head()` / `Waiter::kv_need()` (planner.rs): the FCFS-head
  lookup was spelled out seven times, the demand extraction four times.
- `spawn_watched` (exec.rs): one spawn-plus-join-watchdog scaffold for both
  executors.
- `trace_mark!` (planner.rs): one owner for the pid-tagged marker format;
  `step!` and the six hand-rolled build/rx marker blocks forward to it.
  Output is byte-identical (the analysis scripts keep parsing).

**Applied — hot path**

- The `Impossible` pre-check moved out of `acquire`'s entry (it cost a
  global-KV-lock stats read per nonzero fire, reading an immutable total)
  onto the park path: a demand that reserves off the free lists trivially
  fits. One store-lock hold per fire removed from roomy AND contended.
- `PoolPort::reserve_device_up_to`: the drain's absorb step was a stats
  read + sized reserve = two KV-lock holds per absorb per poke; now one.

**Applied — dead code / docs**

- Deleted: `planner.stats()` / `planner.config()` accessors (no callers),
  the unused `NoReclaim` re-export, `ProcessResidency::snapshot()` (folded
  into `teardown_snapshot`), a dead test binding. `realize_declaration`
  (store-allocating variant) is `#[cfg(test)]` — production is
  grant-funded only. `cancelled_waits` / `host_swap_exhaustions` counters
  were write-only; now surfaced in `PlannerDiagnostics`.
- Doc lies fixed: exec.rs module doc claimed a non-detachable entry aborts
  the eviction (it is skipped; quiescence is the gate); `active_leases`
  claimed the starvation predicate reads it (it deliberately does not);
  `with_inner` claimed to be the single mutation chokepoint (the E6 note
  paths lock directly); stale "contention ladder / orchestrator" mentions;
  the KV taint guard now documents its process-global blast radius.

**Deliberately NOT applied**

- `copy_into`'s Fenced arm parks WITHOUT settling the process's pipeline
  tails — unlike every fire-submit site. An unsettled fire elsewhere keeps
  its lease and the eviction's quiescence then depends on another
  finalizer. This is a LIVENESS question, not a style one: documented at
  the site, tracked under the §15.3 watch items (#25). Do not "align" it
  in a cleanup pass; align it (or prove it safe) with a test.
- `with_inner`'s O(procs) mirror recompute per exit: deliberate
  computed-not-mirrored design; measured as not the residual bottleneck
  (§16 — the residual is resident-set capacity). Revisit only if fleet
  sizes grow an order of magnitude.
- `Inner.evicting` map (mirrors `Proc.state == Evicting` + expected pages):
  derivable state, but the sync sites are exactly the state-flip sites and
  the liveness predicates read it; not worth the churn pre-commit.
- The `outcome: Option<Result> + yielded: bool` encoding (one meaningless
  state) → a three-variant enum: mechanical but touches every delicate
  match in the planner; deferred.
- `acquire`'s outer `loop` never re-iterates (all arms return) — dead
  control structure, left to avoid a 90-line indentation-only diff.
- The lease-refusal path in `acquire_fire_lease` is NOT byte-identical to
  `KvFireLease::drop` (refusal calls `maybe_release` unconditionally, drop
  only at zero) — the review's dedup suggestion was unsound; left as is.

Verified after the pass: 340/340 lib (the pipeline_close_drains flake, #10,
fired at its usual rate — failure is the pre-existing dummy-driver RETRY
race, path semantics unchanged), 2/2 contention integration, and a p9
release bench round (below).

p9 (release, post-cleanup): h2h 13,055 / 12,935 both 128/128 (p5–p8 band
12,873–13,029 — upper edge, consistent with the removed per-fire stats
lock), press 10,752 @ 256/256, roomy 17,191. No regression anywhere.

## §16.3 Final pre-commit regression matrix (#28, 2026-07-26)

Eight scenarios, pie (post-#27 cleanup, release) vs vLLM 0.22.0, one 4090,
Qwen3-0.6B, sequential runs (f1–f8 tags in the bench archive):

| scenario                          | pie              | vLLM            | ratio  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| roomy 256req c128                 | 17,213 / 17,206  | 17,221          | 1.000x |
| roomy 512req c256                 | 19,351           | 19,380          | 0.999x |
| contended h2h (2151pg / 0.217)    | 12,992–13,012 ×3 | 13,919 / 13,923 | 0.933x |
| contended press 256req (256/256)  | 11,017 / 10,948  | 14,149          | 0.775x |
| contended long-gen 64×1024 c64    | 7,330            | 7,698           | 0.952x |
| caps present, demand below cap    | 9,201            | 9,162           | 1.004x |
| single-request latency (tok/s)    | 519              | 486             | 1.068x |

Every pie cell sits inside its historical band; no regression anywhere.
New reference points: vLLM press 14,149 (the press gap 0.78x is the widest
cell — same resident-set capacity residual as h2h, §16, amplified by
sustained churn); long-gen 0.95x is a first measurement of the deep-decode
eviction regime.

**temperature 1.0 (f8): wedges — and is NOT ours.** The contended temp-1.0
run timed out at warmup (2 lanes, a launch batch stuck `settled=false` for
849 s, planner uninvolved). Isolation: reproduces roomy (no caps, 16 req)
on the cleaned tree AND on the BASE commit 45592f9ee (pre-Rainer, ladder
era) with the identical signature — a pre-existing sampling-path
(temperature > 0) completion wedge, tracked as #15, independent of this
branch's uncommitted work. All throughput benches here and historically
run greedy (temp 0), so the matrix above is unaffected.

## §17 The tp=1 gap attacked at its mechanism (#29, 2026-07-26)

User directive: pie should beat vLLM at tp=1 — fix the runtime gap
(h2h 0.933x, press 0.775x after §16.3).

**Page-ledger measurement first** (PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS=500 sampler +
PIE_FIRE_TIMING waves, g1-* logs). The pool is NOT the problem: idle
(free+accum) averaged 0.5% h2h / 0.8% press. The gap is ABSENTEEISM:
- h2h: GPU idle only 5.9% (waves overlap 157%), but rows/wave p50 69 vs
  vLLM ~104. ~32 processes parked in the allocation queue at any tick;
  every page-boundary crossing parks behind the eviction-landing cadence
  (park→serve p50 6.2 ms ≈ evict chain: lease-quiesce 9.1 ms — exactly the
  2-frame run-ahead drain — + D2H commit 6.2 ms). head_pages avg 22.4: the
  head is often a whole-working-set restore, and at free=0 even the elder
  bypass fails, so every boundary ask convoys.
- press: idle 27.8% — transfer-bound. H2D wall 2.7 ms/page vs D2H 0.34.
  Swap copies were issued as one cudaMemcpyAsync per (layer, K/V, page):
  ~56 calls × ~32 KB per page, 1,300+ calls per restore — submission
  overhead, not PCIe (pinned buffers sustain ~0.07 ms/page).

**Fix #1 — lease-quiescent victim preference** (planner.rs plan_eviction +
residency::kv_lease_quiescent): among the eligible victims (younger than
head, resident, progressed — eligibility unchanged, so anti-thrash and E6
hold), prefer those with ZERO active fire leases right now; youngest-first
within each class. A quiescent victim skips the 9 ms lease drain. Press
evict quiesce p50 9.1 → 0.1 ms (g2); h2h unchanged (all candidates carry
2-frame tails there — expected).

**Fix #2 — batched swap copies** (driver swap_pool.cpp): the per-page
56-call loop replaced by ONE cudaMemcpyBatchAsync per transfer set (CUDA
12.8+ API; toolkit 13.3). d2h + h2d paths; d2d left as-is.

| run           | h2h            | press (256/256)   | roomy  |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| g1 (baseline) | 12,963         | 10,374            |   —    |
| g2 (#1)       | 12,895         | 10,624            |   —    |
| g3 (#1+#2)    | **13,346 / 13,332** | **11,488 / 11,447** | 17,187 |

vs vLLM (§16.3 refs): h2h 0.933 → **0.958–0.959x**; press 0.775 →
**0.809–0.812x**; roomy parity unchanged. press GPU idle 27.8 → 20.8%;
park→serve p99 215 → 112 ms. Verified: lib 340/340, integration 2/2,
roomy in-band.

**Remaining levers, ranked (measured, not guessed):**
1. Engine-side single control slot serializes ALL standalone copies —
   H2D still waits 2.0 ms/page WALL (queueing behind D2H + slot). Allow
   N standalone copies in flight (worker.rs in_flight_control → small
   set for the standalone class), THEN split the swap stream into
   d2h/h2d pair for full-duplex PCIe. Press's remaining 20.8% idle.
2. h2h rows/wave (69 vs 104): boundary asks convoy behind large restore
   heads. A BOUNDED small-ask service while a big head accumulates
   (arithmetic bound, no timers) — needs a liveness argument against
   head starvation before implementing.
3. Restore chunking: land a restore in page runs and lift the fence
   early — bigger surgery (per-working-set fence granularity).

### §17.1 Lever-1 execution: the real coupling was in the driver (g4–g6)

Reading the engine's control slot for the planned multi-slot surgery
surfaced something better: the driver's `copy_kv` completed EVERY tracked
copy on the COMPUTE stream, with a `cudaStreamWaitEvent` joining the swap
stream into it — every suspend/restore transfer stalled all later launches
behind PCIe, undoing engine-side `holds_launches = false` at the stream
level. **Fix #3**: standalone page copies (no cells) now complete on the
swap stream itself; no compute-stream join (host-side happens-before —
completion → ledger commit → later fires — covers device visibility). The
mixed cells+pages descriptor keeps the join.

Results and two instructive failures:
- g4 (#1+#2+#3): h2h 13,414 (best; transfer walls collapse: d2h 400→174 ms,
  h2d 2112→1228 ms) but press 10,721 — cheap transfers sped up the
  evict⇄restore ROTATION (evictions 280→374): the slow copies had been an
  accidental thrash brake.
- g5 (asker-last victim ordering): rejected by measurement — rotation
  count unchanged, h2h −5% (busier victims, slower quiesce). Reverted.
- g6 (final = #1+#2+#3): h2h **13,423 / 13,387 (0.963x)**, press
  **11,253 / 10,981** (spread band ~11.0–11.5 vs vLLM 14,149 ≈ 0.79x),
  roomy **17,243** (parity+, band top). Tests 340/340 + 2/2.

Day total (#29): h2h 0.933x → **0.963x**; press center ≈ +5–10% with the
known ±3% spread; roomy untouched.

**The remaining press gap is now a DESIGN question, not a tuning one:**
funding a restore head by evicting younger residents rotates membership —
each rotation ships a whole working set D2H+H2D to buy one process a seat
someone else just lost. Directions (each needs a liveness argument against
rainer.md's FCFS core, none is a cleanup-pass change):
  (a) restores funded from organic frees only (completions), with
      eviction redirected to the oldest ALLOCATION ask — kills rotation,
      but an immortal fleet could starve an evictee indefinitely;
  (b) restore chunking (partial fence lift);
  (c) accept 0.79x press as the FCFS-fairness price at 2x oversub.
h2h's remaining 4% is the rows/wave occupancy (69 vs vLLM ~104) — the
bounded small-ask-service-under-a-large-head idea, same design tier.

## §18 The 33-case pie-vs-vLLM contention matrix (#30, 2026-07-26)

User directive: benchmark pie's contention management against vLLM across
many workload shapes and contention levels (>= 30 cases), and profile
anything that loses badly or hangs.

Environment: one RTX 4090, Qwen3-0.6B, tp=1, greedy (temperature 0),
`ignore_eos`, prefix caching OFF on both engines, pie @ `61a678bf1`
(= origin/dev, Rainer v1 + §17 fixes), vLLM 0.22.0 / torch 2.11.0+cu130.
Raw records: session `files/run1` (33 cases), `run2` (repeat sample),
`trace/`, `adm-P1092/`.

### §18.1 Methodology fix: the budgets are now token-for-token identical

Every prior comparison sized the two engines by *calibrating* a memory
fraction (pie util 0.26 vs vLLM 0.217, "0.9% apart"). That slack is the
same order as several of the effects being measured. Both engines are now
driven by an exact block count instead:

| engine | knob | result |
|---|---|---|
| pie  | driver option `total_pages = P` (16 tok/page) | `kv_tokens = 16P` |
| vLLM | `num_gpu_blocks_override = P`, `block_size = 16` | `GPU KV cache size: 16P tokens` |

Verified at P=2151: both report **34,416 tokens**. Harness knobs added:
`benches/pie_bench.py --total-pages/--swap-pool-size` (§10 trap 2/3 — the
shipped harness could not express a KV cap at all) and
`benches/vllm_bench.py --num-gpu-blocks-override/--block-size`.

Oversubscription **X = concurrency x (prompt + max_tokens) / 16P**.

### §18.2 The matrix

33 cases, one sample each (8 re-sampled in `run2`). **No hangs, no
timeouts.**

**Spread — corrected 2026-07-26 (§18.11).** The original claim here ("vLLM
<0.5%, pie <0.4% at parity cells") was an artefact of `run1` and `run2`
landing in the same regime. Controlled re-measurement found the roomy
cells are **bimodal by ~10% on the shipped tree**: A1 15.3-17.2K, A2
15.5-16.8K, on BOTH the baseline and the modified build. Treat any
single-sample per-case delta below ~10% on A1/A2 as noise.

### §18.3 The gap tracks CHURN, not pressure

The A-sweep reads like a pressure curve, but the controlled experiment says
otherwise. Same budget (P=2184), same offered concurrency (128), same
shape — **only the number of requests varies**, i.e. how many times the
fleet turns over:

| nreq | refills | tok/s | ratio | evictions | evict/req | pages moved | pages/req |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128 (F4) | 0 | 13,578 | **0.967x** | 66 | 0.52 | 2,678 | 20.9 |
| 256 (A4) | 1 | 11,618 | 0.815x | 399 | 1.56 | 12,495 | 48.8 |
| 512 (E2) | 3 | 10,946 | 0.744x | 776 | 1.52 | 25,392 | 49.6 |

(throughput from `run1`; counters from matched `PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS=500`
re-runs, which cost ~8% themselves.)

**A single oversubscribed wave is nearly free — 0.967x at 2x oversub.** The
price is paid by *arrivals into a full pool*: one refill triples evictions
per request and more than doubles pages moved per request. E3 (1024 req,
the most turnover in the matrix) is the worst cell at 0.705x.

### §18.4 What the ledger shows: a 70-page round trip to deliver 1 page

E3 traced, final sample (67 s run, 1,024 requests):

```
queue=31 head_pages=1 head_kind=allocation accum=4 free=0/1092 host_free=3744/4096
parks=19651 serves=18744 evictions=1608 restores=1588 evict_rollbacks=0
d2h_pages=26668 h2d_pages=26316 d2h_ms=3462 h2d_ms=5906 resident=56 evicted=20
```

- `free=0/1092` in **every** sample: the pool is pinned at zero.
- `head_pages=1 head_kind=allocation` dominates: the head is a decode
  crossing a page boundary and needing **one** page.
- To supply it the planner evicts a whole working set (26,668 D2H pages /
  1,608 evictions = **16.6 pages per eviction**), and that victim then
  re-queues for a full restore (1,588 restores). **~33 pages of PCIe
  traffic move to hand one page to the head** (52,984 pages / 1,608
  evict-restore cycles = 32.9; a victim evicted at full length costs
  ~70, but the measured average victim is mid-flight).
- Total 52,984 pages moved against 35,840 pages of real demand
  (1,024 x 35) = **1.48 pages copied per page of KV actually wanted**, and
  9.4 s of copy time inside a 67 s run.
- `evict_rollbacks=0`, `restore_failures=0`, `hogs=0`: the machinery is
  working exactly as designed. This is the design's cost, not a defect.

vLLM does **zero** of this. Its scheduler holds the surplus at the door:
A6 logs `Running: 48 reqs, Waiting: 34 reqs, GPU KV cache usage: 98.8%`,
A7 `Running: 24, Waiting: 107, usage: 100.0%`, with no preemption lines at
all. It never commits KV it cannot sustain, so it never has to move any.

### §18.5 The mechanism: contention collapses pie's run-ahead overlap

Pie's throughput is `rows_per_batch / wall_per_batch`. Comparing the
harness's own batch accounting against wall time across the A-sweep
(`total batches`, `total requests`, `avg batch latency us`, `wall`):

| case | X | rows/batch | batch latency | wall/batch | overlap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | 0.5x | 128.0 | 13.78 ms | 7.44 ms | **185%** |
| A2 | 1.0x | 123.3 | 13.14 ms | 7.33 ms | 179% |
| A3 | 1.5x | 92.6 | 8.65 ms | 7.10 ms | 122% |
| A4 | 2.0x | 85.1 | 6.95 ms | 7.32 ms | 95% |
| A5 | 3.0x | 61.2 | 5.61 ms | 6.44 ms | 87% |
| A6 | 4.0x | 48.8 | 4.75 ms | 5.75 ms | **83%** |
| A7 | 8.0x | 24.9 | 3.72 ms | 4.17 ms | 89% |

Roomy, pie keeps ~1.85 batches in flight (the Venus run-ahead) and ties
vLLM to four digits. Under contention the overlap falls below 1.0: the GPU
waits between batches. Every page-boundary crossing parks its lane, and the
lane cannot submit its next fire until an eviction has physically landed —
so the eviction latency, not the kernel, sets the cadence.

Head to head at P=1092 the two engines run *the same batch width* and pie
is still 37% slower per step:

| | rows/step | wall/step | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|
| pie (conc 128) | 49.0 | 6.10 ms | 8,043 |
| vLLM (self-limited to 50 running) | 50 | 4.45 ms | 11,226 |

### §18.6 It is NOT over-admission — pie's own optimum is still 0.78x

The obvious hypothesis is that pie admits 128 where vLLM admits 48, so
capping admission would close the gap. Measured, it does not. Admission
sweep at P=1092 (resident capacity ~31 requests at full length), vLLM given
the full 128 offered load for reference:

| pie conc | 16 | 24 | 31 | 40 | **48** | 64 | 96 | 128 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tok/s | 5,133 | 7,190 | 8,243 | 8,586 | **8,770** | 8,456 | 8,042 | 8,043 |

vLLM, same budget, full offered load: **11,226**.

Pie's best achievable throughput at this budget, over every admission
level, is 8,770 = **0.78x** of what vLLM gets. Admission tuning is worth
+9% (8,043 -> 8,770); the remaining 22% is the residency mechanism itself.
This kills tuning as a fix and confirms §17.1's reading: the cost is the
evict/restore **rotation**, and rotation is what FCFS-by-spawn requires
whenever a younger process must fund an older head.

Corollary for the shape cells: the losses are worst where working sets are
large relative to the budget and turn over fast (C1/D1 short-short 0.755x /
0.776x, C4/D4 long/long 0.768x / 0.795x) and mildest where each request
holds its pages only briefly (C3/D3 long-prompt/short-gen 0.918x / 0.942x)
or where half the fleet is short-lived (C5 mixed-phase 0.960x).

### §18.7 F2 — a request is failed loud, and the message named the wrong cause

F2 is the extreme edge: P=40 pages (640 tokens) against a 546-token
request, concurrency 16 (X = 13.65x). vLLM completes 32/32. **Pie drops a
request in 4 of 7 runs** — intermittent, race-dependent:

```
decode frame submit: pipeline: KV capacity: KV pool starved under host swap
exhaustion: 1 pages asked, 0 free of 40, no swap room to evict into, ...
```

The message is wrong. The traced failure shows `host_free=4069/4096` — the
host swap pool was **99.3% empty**. The real state at the kill:

```
queue=2 head_pages=17 head_kind=restore accum=9 free=0/40 resident=1 evicted=2
```

One resident holds the pool; the head is a 17-page restore. `plan_eviction`
builds its candidate set from `proc.seq > head_seq && Resident &&
progressed` — the FCFS anti-thrash rule, which forbids evicting anyone
**older** than the head. The sole page-holder is older, so `picks` is empty,
and the fall-through calls `check_starvation`, which fails the youngest
parked allocation loud. `PlannerError::Starved`'s `Display` hardcoded
"under host swap exhaustion" for *both* of `check_starvation`'s callers,
so it misattributed a policy wedge to a resource exhaustion.

**Fixed** (`runtime/engine/src/planner.rs`): a `StarveCause`
(`NoSwapRoom` | `NoEligibleVictim`) is threaded from each caller into the
error and the `tracing::warn!`. The same failure now reports:

```
KV pool starved: 1 pages asked, 0 free of 40, no evictable victim — every
page is held by a process OLDER than the head, which FCFS anti-thrash
forbids evicting, and no fire in flight anywhere to complete and free pages
```

Diagnostics only — no policy change. Lib tests 343/343.

The underlying behaviour was a **real gap**: when the budget is near one
working set, pie's ordering reached a state with no legal move and
destroyed a request, where vLLM simply serializes and completes all of
them. Root-caused and fixed in §18.9.

### §18.8 Standing summary

- **Parity is real and reproducible** at or below capacity (A1 1.000x,
  A2 0.987x, B1 1.017x, B2 0.992x, F1 0.984x) and for a single
  oversubscribed wave (F4 0.967x). Pie's kernels and batching are not the
  problem.
- **The contended deficit is 0.70-0.82x**, driven by fleet turnover, not by
  pressure level; it plateaus at ~0.76x beyond 3x oversub.
- **The cause is rotation economics**, quantified: 1.48 pages of PCIe
  traffic per page of demand, ~33 pages moved per 1-page head, and a
  run-ahead overlap that falls 185% -> 83%.
- **Not fixable by admission control** (best case 0.78x) — it is the design
  question §17.1 already framed, now with a measured ceiling on the tuning
  branch.
- The three directions from §17.1 (organic-frees-only restores; restore
  chunking; accept the FCFS price) are unchanged.
- **F2's request destruction is fixed** (§18.9); the throughput gap is not.


## §18.9 F2 root cause: E6 hysteresis in the liveness path (#31, 2026-07-26)

§18.7 recorded the symptom (a request destroyed in 4 of 7 F2 runs) and
corrected the message. This is the mechanism and the fix.

### The wedge, captured

Instrumenting the no-pick fall-through and the kill decision
(`PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS`, both trace-gated) caught the state exactly:

```
NOPICK head_seq=32 deficit=1 procs: older_or_head=1 nonresident=0
       not_progressed=1 eligible_but_quoted_zero=0

WEDGE-KILL cause=NoEligibleVictim
  queue=[31:alloc:need=1, 32:restore:need=12, 33:alloc:need=1]
  procs=[32:Evicted:prog=true, 31:Resident:prog=true, 33:Resident:prog=false]
```

The head asks for **one page**. The only resident younger than the head
(seq 33) holds the pool, and is excluded solely by E6 — `progressed=false`.

**Why the veto never lifts.** `progressed` is cleared when a restore lands
and is set only inside `acquire` (`note_progress` /
`note_ask_and_check_elder`). A process that is restored and then parks on
an unmet ask never reaches another `acquire` — it is waiting for pages —
so its veto is permanent. Meanwhile it is the only thing that could fund
the head. Circular, and `check_starvation` reads the circle as "no
completion can ever arrive" and destroys the youngest ask.

E6 is documented as **hysteresis** ("one line of membership hysteresis: a
restored member stays a member until one fire completes", rainer.md §14),
while rainer.md §15 requires "no timers, no knobs, no heuristics **in any
liveness path**". E6 sitting where it can force a destruction violates
that criterion on the design's own terms.

### The fix, and the wrong version of it first

**Wrong version (recorded because the failure mode is instructive):** relax
E6 whenever the normal candidate set yields no picks. `picks` comes up
empty *routinely* — 15,139 times in one 30 s F2 run — so relaxation fired
593 times, and phase 3's own `!proc.progressed` re-validation then
silently rejected every relaxed pick. Result: a **livelock**, throughput
654 -> 49 tok/s and 29/32 completed. Worse than the bug.

**Landed version:** E6 relaxation is the last rung *before* destruction,
gated on the wedge predicate itself:

- the wedge test is extracted to `ResidencyPlanner::is_wedged()` so the
  relaxation rung and `check_starvation` cannot disagree on what "wedged"
  means;
- `plan_eviction` collects eligible and E6-vetoed candidates separately;
  on an empty pick it runs `check_hog`, and only if `is_wedged()` holds
  does it re-quote the E6-vetoed set;
- an `e6_relaxed` flag threads to phase 3 so the re-validation accepts the
  relaxed pick (this is what the wrong version missed);
- counter `e6_relaxations`, surfaced in the sampler line as `e6_relax=`.

Anti-thrash is untouched: victims are still strictly younger than the head
and still Resident. Only E6's hysteresis yields, and only in the state that
would otherwise destroy a request.

### Verification

| | F2 completed 32/32 | tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| before | **3 of 7 runs** | 654 |
| naive relaxation | 1 of 2 (livelock) | 49 |
| landed fix | **25 of 26 runs** | 563-665 (unchanged) |

`e6_relax` fires 0-2 times per F2 run. Under normal contention it fires
**zero** times: a traced E3 run (1,024 req, 1,679 evictions, 1,663
restores) reports `e6_relax=0 starved=0`. The rung is inert outside the
endgame, which is why throughput is unmoved:

| case | pre s1 | pre s2 | post-fix | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | 17,193 | 17,220 | 17,161 | in band |
| A4 | 11,618 | 10,867 | 11,534 | in band |
| A6 | 8,486 | 7,689 | 8,145 | in band |
| B3 | 12,352 | 12,368 | 12,727 | in band |
| C1 | 10,123 | 10,440 | 10,352 | in band |
| E2 | 10,946 | 10,605 | 10,592 | in band |
| E3 | 7,902 | 7,877 | 7,592 / 7,840 / 7,737 | in band (4% spread) |
| F4 | 13,578 | 13,539 | 13,489 | in band |

Lib tests 343/343 and the full `--tests` suite green. One integration
test had to move with the message: `contention_host_full`'s
`host_swap_exhaustion_kills_a_victim_without_wedging_the_fleet` asserted
on the literal `"host swap exhaustion"`. That case sets `cpu_pages = 0`,
so it is genuinely `StarveCause::NoSwapRoom`; it now asserts on
`"no host swap room to evict into"`. (It is worth noting that a `--lib`
run does NOT catch this — the message assertions live in `--test`
targets.) `planner.rs` rustfmt diffs 10 -> 7 (all remaining pre-existing).

### Residual: a second, rarer wedge class

One of the 26 runs still failed, in a **different** state — both processes
`prog=true`, so E6 was not involved:

```
WEDGE-KILL cause=NoEligibleVictim
  queue=[32:alloc:need=1, 33:alloc:need=1]
  procs=[33:Resident:prog=true, 32:Resident:prog=true]
```

Root-caused in §18.10 — and the guess in this paragraph was wrong: the
victim's quote was not `Nothing` at all.


## §18.10 The residual 1-in-26: a stale candidate snapshot (#32, 2026-07-26)

§18.9 left one failure in 26. Two more repros were captured with the
per-process `ReclaimQuote` dump, and they were **two different states** —
neither matching the §18.9 guess that the victim was unreclaimable:

**Repro A** (E6-vetoed victim, healthy quote):
```
procs  = [33:Resident prog=FALSE, 32:Resident prog=true]
quotes = [33:Pages(19), 32:Pages(21)]
head   = 32:alloc need=1
```
**Repro B** (ordinary victim, healthy quote, E6 not involved at all):
```
head   = 19:alloc need=1
19: Resident prog=true  quote=Pages(27)   (the head itself)
20: Resident prog=true  quote=Pages(13)   <- eligible by every rule
21,22,23: Evicted (AllSwapped); 24-33: Resident, HoldsNothing
```
In both, a victim younger than the head sat there holding double-digit
reclaimable pages while the planner destroyed a request for want of ONE.

### Root cause: the kill is decided on a snapshot nobody re-read

`plan_eviction` samples the candidate set in phase 1, releases the lock to
quote (quoting takes store locks), and only much later reaches
`check_starvation`. A process that was `Evicting` or `Restoring` at sample
time is in **neither** the eligible nor the E6-vetoed list — and
`is_wedged()` is false while anything is in transit, so the §18.9
relaxation rung, gated on that same predicate, correctly declined to fire.
Then the transfer lands, the process becomes `Resident` holding its pages,
`is_wedged()` flips true, and `check_starvation` kills — using a candidate
scan taken before that process existed as a candidate.

§18.9 fixed only the E6 half of this (repro A) and only from the stale
snapshot; repro B shows the same gap swallowing an *ordinary* candidate,
which E6 relaxation could never have reached.

### Fix

`ResidencyPlanner::last_resort_evict()` — invoked from `check_starvation`
immediately before the kill, re-reading the process table **at that
instant**:

1. ordinary candidates (E6 honoured) — no hysteresis is spent if a
   normally-eligible victim exists;
2. E6-vetoed candidates — hysteresis yields rather than let a request die.

Eligibility is otherwise unchanged (strictly younger than the head, still
Resident), so FCFS anti-thrash — the real safety property — is untouched.
Phase 3 was extracted to `commit_evictions()` so the mark/yield/spawn step
is shared by both entry points.

**Gated on `cause == NoEligibleVictim`.** Under `NoSwapRoom` there is
nowhere to evict *into*: a pick would be marked `Evicting`, fail in the
executor, roll back, and repeat forever. Running the rung unconditionally
made `contention_host_full` spin until its 10 s timeout — which is what
earns the `StarveCause` distinction added in §18.7 its keep.

### Verification

| build | F2 completed 32/32 |
|---|---|
| pre-§18.9 | 3 of 7 |
| §18.9 | 25 of 26 |
| §18.10 | **45 of 45** |

- `last-resort-evict` fires **0** times under normal contention (traced E3,
  1,024 req, ~1,200 evictions): the rung is inert outside the endgame.
- Throughput, 3 samples per case, post-fix vs the three pre-fix samples:
  A1 17,192-17,237 (pre 17,161-17,220), A4 11,178-11,439 (10,867-11,618),
  A6 8,146-8,545 (7,689-8,486), B3 12,404-12,724 (12,352-12,727),
  C1 10,227-10,615 (10,123-10,440), E2 10,509-10,573 (10,592-10,946),
  F4 13,536-13,583 (13,489-13,578), E3 7,598-7,786 (7,592-7,902). In band
  everywhere.
- Full `--tests` suite green (343 lib + 43 integration).

**One observed hang was NOT this change.** A traced E3 run wedged with the
seal watchdog (`frame k=1 lanes=64 awaited=64 sealed=0 pending_binds=2`),
planner uninvolved (`starved=0 e6_relax=0`, last-resort 0). Controlled
A/B — engine changes stashed, harness kept — gives **0 hangs in 5 traced
E3 runs on the baseline and 0 in 5 on the fixed build**. It is the
pre-existing intermittent seal-path wedge (§1b, #15 class), not a
regression; it is not reproducible at this rate and remains open.

### What is still open

- The throughput gap (§18.3-§18.6) is untouched by any of this.
- The seal-watchdog wedge above.
- The starvation rung itself remains reachable in principle: if no victim
  younger than the head holds reclaimable pages at the kill instant, a
  request still dies. No such state has been observed since the fix, but
  nothing proves it unreachable — the FCFS "never evict your senior" rule
  is what leaves the possibility open, and only the §17.1 (a) redesign
  removes it structurally.

## §19 Design consequences → `rainer_v3.md` (2026-07-26)

The defects in §18.7–§18.10 were not four unrelated bugs. Three of the
four (and the §1 livelock and §12 deadlock before them) are one class:
**a decision taken on state that was already stale when it was acted on.**
`last_resort_evict()` (§18.10) is a hand-rolled emulation of the one
property that fixes the class — re-read a consistent snapshot at the
instant of an irreversible decision — which is exactly what `rainer.md`
v2's single-writer boundary pass provides structurally.

That changes v2's standing. `rainer.md` §10 parked it as "a robustness
refactor ... not a rewrite justified by throughput". The throughput half
of that verdict still holds (§18.4 says the contended gap is rotation
economics, which v2 reduces but does not remove). The robustness half was
weighed against no evidence; there is evidence now — three destroyed
requests and one self-inflicted livelock, in one session, all in that seam.

`rainer_v3.md` records the full argument plus the three defects v2 does
NOT address:

1. **Liveness and policy share one funnel, enforced by nothing.** §15's
   "no heuristics in any liveness path" is prose; E6 sat there until it
   destroyed requests. Proposal: make it a type — an exact `VictimSet`
   from the boundary pass that only endgame predicates may consume, and
   an `Ordering` over it that heuristics may reorder but never empty.
2. **`ReclaimQuote` conflates a durable fact with a transient one.**
   `pages()` returns 0 for every `Nothing` variant, and `check_hog` reads
   it as "pages held" — so a head holding 39 pages reads as holding 0 the
   moment one in-flight pin overlaps, the hog predicate never fires, and
   the starvation rung destroys the innocent youngest instead. Code-evident,
   **not yet reproduced at runtime**. It is the same collapse `NoReclaim`'s
   own doc comment warns about, one level down: the *reason* was split into
   variants, the *quantity* is still overloaded.
3. **The eviction unit is not the ask unit.** §18.4 measured it: a 1-page
   head funded by a whole-working-set evict + restore, ~33 pages moved per
   page delivered (32.9 measured; ~70 for a full-length victim).
   §17.1(b) is promoted from a lever to the central structural change,
   because that is where the gap physically is.

Suggested order (each independently landable): the `ReclaimQuote` accessor
split first (small, local, removes a latent request-destroying bug), then
the typed liveness boundary, then v2's boundary pass, then divisible
residency — the only item that moves 0.70–0.82x.

## §18.11 Two benchmarking traps found while gating the v3 work (2026-07-26)

Both were caught by A/B-ing the engine changes against the stashed tree
(engine files stashed, harness kept), and both had already produced a false
alarm before being identified.

**Trap 1 — preceding GPU load.** A full 33-case matrix run (`run3`) started
after ~40 minutes of continuous benchmarking reported pie's roomy A1 at
15,636 vs `run1`'s 17,193 (-9.1%), while vLLM in the same run was
unchanged. Rested re-measurement of the SAME build gave 17,145-17,175 over
five runs. The matrix is sensitive to what ran before it; per-case deltas
across differently-conditioned runs are not comparable. Compare only
runs taken from a comparable state, or A/B back to back.

**Trap 2 — engine-level regime bistability, ~10%.** The roomy cells are
bimodal, and it is NOT a property of this branch:

| case | baseline (stashed) | with §3.1-§3.3 |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | 17,124 / 17,192 / 17,124 / 17,168 / 17,205 | 17,145-17,175 (5) |
| A2 | 16,750 / 16,637 / **15,482** | 15,263 / 16,658 |
| C5 | 7,424 / 7,423 / 7,549 | **7,680 / 7,706** |

A2 straddles ~15.5K and ~16.8K on both builds. C5's apparent -11.7% in
`run3` inverts under controlled comparison — the modified build is 2-3%
FASTER than baseline, and `run1`'s 8,556 was the outlier.

This is the engine-level instance of what `rainer.md` L3 calls performance
resting "on a stable accident" and what its §15 promises v2 would remove
("regime bistability is eliminated, not won"). It had been characterised
for inferlets (A10, synthid) but not, as far as this record goes, for
engine roomy throughput. **Consequence for every future comparison: a
single-sample roomy delta under ~10% carries no information.**

Verdict for the v3 work: **no regression.** Controlled 5-vs-5 on A1 and
3-vs-3 on A2/C5 put the modified build at or above baseline everywhere.

## §18.12 Standing state after the v3 work (2026-07-26)

Landed, each independently gated:

| item | effect | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| §18.7 `StarveCause` | the starvation error names its real cause | reproduced live |
| §18.9 E6 out of the liveness path | F2 3/7 → 25/26 | + a rejected naive version that livelocked (654→49 tok/s) |
| §18.10 kill decided at the kill instant | F2 → 45/45 | two repros, two different wedge classes |
| v3 §3.3 `held_pages` / `ReclaimQuote::pages()` deleted | a latent hog under-count removed, misuse now unrepresentable | unit test on the pin divergence |
| v3 §3.2 `VictimSet` | E6 is a tag, never a filter | — |
| v3 §3.1 step 1: atomic endgame snapshot | the stale-snapshot seam closed for the endgame | F2 20/20 |
| v3 §8.5: elder bypass deleted (−23) | one ordering rule gone, free | A4/A6/E3 in band, F2 12/12 |

Final verification, all at once: full suite **344 lib + 43 integration**,
**F2 15/15**, throughput **in band on 8 cases** against a 7-sample band,
`planner.rs` rustfmt diffs unchanged from baseline (7).

Rejected after measurement — recorded so nobody re-does them:
- **v3 §3.4** divisible residency / declared intent (user decision; sign
  uncertain, g4 counter-evidence, large mechanism).
- **§8.4** funding-batch: +35 lines, zero throughput change on
  A4/A6/E3/E2 — the bottleneck is eviction latency, not port round trips.
- The naive E6 relaxation (§18.9) and the asker-last ordering (§17.1 g5).

Not attempted: v2's boundary pass proper. §8.5 records why the sequencing
is worse than it looks — membership push alone deletes nothing, and the
117 deletable lines arrive only with the full funding model, indivisibly.

The contended **0.70-0.82x vs vLLM stands untouched** and is accepted cost
(§17.1(c)). Nothing in this session's work was aimed at it, and §18.6
showed the tuning branch tops out at 0.78x.

## §20 Extreme stress test vs vLLM 0.26.0 — three liveness defects (2026-07-27)

Scope: hunt every **deadlock / livelock / performance regression** corner
case in the residency planner and the frame scheduler, with vLLM 0.26.0 as
the control. L40S 46GB sm_89, CUDA 13.0 toolkit + compat driver,
Qwen3-0.6B, tp=1, greedy, `ignore_eos`. Parity per §18.1: pie
`--total-pages P` ⟷ vLLM `--num-gpu-blocks-override P --block-size 16`,
both exactly 16P tokens; prefix caching off on both.

Method: (a) 14 adversarial single-engine liveness probes aimed at the
planner endgame, (b) a 35-cell pie-vs-vLLM parity matrix over 5 workload
shapes × oversubscription X ∈ {0.5 … 32}.

**Four** defects, all liveness, all independent, all reachable with
**default** configuration: an admission-cap deadlock (§20.1), a starvation
kill on a fundable pool (§20.2), a frame-seal/bind deadlock (§20.3), and a
host-swap eviction livelock (§20.6).

### §20.1 Defect 1 — the admission-cap wedge (permanent deadlock)

Four probes (`noswap_4x`, `noswap_16x`, `tinyswap`, `allshared_noswap`)
hung for the full 150 s deadline emitting one frozen trace 300 times:

    queue=64 head_pages=1 accum=0 free=0/128 host_free=0/0
    parks=64 serves=0 evictions=0 starved=0 e6_relax=0
    resident=128 evicting=0 evicted=0 restoring=0

Zero serves, zero evictions, zero starvation kills. The queue head wanted
**one** page out of a 128-page pool and never got it.

**Root cause.** `Planner::is_wedged()` required *every* `Residency::Resident`
process to be parked before `check_starvation` would arm. But
`planner.register()` runs at `spawn()` — registration order *is* the FCFS
clock — while a process only touches pooled KV after **execution
admission** (`ensure_execution_admitted`). So whenever
`num_requests > max_concurrent_processes`:

* the admitted cohort (64) parks on an exhausted pool;
* the unadmitted remainder (64) sits in `procs` as `Resident` holding
  **exactly zero pages**, waiting for a permit only a completion can free;
* `is_wedged()` reads those 64 as "someone is still running" and returns
  false forever, disarming the only rung that can break the cycle.

A textbook circular wait: the parked hold the permits the unadmitted need,
and the unadmitted disarm the rung that would free the parked. Note
`swap_pool_size` defaults to 0, so this is reachable out of the box.

**Fix.** `Proc::admitted`, set by `Planner::note_admitted()` called from
`ensure_execution_admitted`. `is_wedged()` no longer counts an unadmitted
process as relief, and `victim_set()` no longer quotes one. Soundness: the
only `planner.acquire` call site is `pipeline/fire.rs`, reachable only
downstream of `ensure_execution_admitted`, so an unadmitted process
provably holds zero device pages. New `admitted=` field in the trace.

**Test.** `runtime/engine/tests/contention_admission_wedge.rs` — 5 lanes,
admission cap 2, `cpu_pages = 0`. Hangs on the pre-fix tree, passes on the
fixed one. Live: 150 s hang → 3.7-4.7 s with real progress, on all four
probes.

### §20.2 Defect 2 — the starvation rung kills on a fundable pool

The 35-cell matrix ran clean (zero deadlocks) except two cells that each
destroyed exactly one request. `PlannerError::Starved` printed its own
contradiction:

    4 pages asked, 35 free of 69
    42 pages asked, 49 free of 97

**Root cause.** A drain only reaches `plan_eviction` when
`reserve_device_up_to` comes back empty, but *everything after that* —
`is_wedged`, the exhaustive `last_resort_evict` scan under the global KV
lock, the trace dump — is a wide window in which a retiring process
returns its pages. Worse, the window is *biased*: a process leaves `procs`
at `unregister` **before** its page leases drop, so the wedge predicate
goes true strictly **before** the pool refills. The kill site
re-validated `accum` but never re-checked the pool.

**Fix.** `salvage_free_pages()` — re-run the drain's own
`reserve_device_up_to` primitive and absorb the result into `accum`, then
poke. Called twice in `check_starvation`: once before `last_resort_evict`,
once immediately before the kill. Deliberately a *reservation attempt*,
not an `available_pages() > 0` counter comparison — the counter version can
spin forever when pages are visible but unreservable, i.e. it trades a
false kill for a livelock. New `salvages_total` diagnostic.

**Test.** `mod starvation_race_tests` in `planner.rs` with a `RacePool`
mock `PoolPort` that refills exactly inside the window; red before, green
after. Live: probe `s64` (`--total-pages 8`, 512 requests, conc 64)
→ `starved=0 salvaged=1 512/512`. Both matrix cells 3/3 at 256/256, and D
X=32 throughput 867 → 888 tok/s.

### §20.3 Defect 3 — the rebind/frame-seal deadlock (`bind → dispatch → seal → bind`)

The `churn_extreme` cell collapsed 18x. First it had to be *cleared* of
being a planner-scaling problem: the same shape with a 900 s client
deadline recovers fully (238 → 3789 tok/s), so the engine is sound and the
collapse is not throughput. It is an intermittent **permanent scheduler
deadlock**, ~10-15% of runs (1 in 6-10).

Repro: `--total-pages 96 --swap-pool-size 16384 --num-requests 4096
--concurrency 1024 --max-tokens 16 --max-model-len 1536`. Timing-sensitive:
`PIE_FIRE_TIMING=1` makes it vanish (8/8 clean), so it must be chased with
`PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS` alone.

Frozen planner trace (new `runners` dump, added for this):

    queue=1000 head_pages=4 accum=0 free=0/96 host_free=16384/16384
    starved=0 salvaged=0 resident=1817 admitted=1024
    runners=[2280:h4:ptrue, ...×24]

24 consecutive spawn seqs each holding exactly 4 pages — the entire
96-page pool, and every one marked `progressed`. Frame dump at the same
instant (new `[frame-stall]` trace):

    frame k=1 lanes=24 awaited=24 sealed=0 pending_binds=8 staged=793
    joins_in_flight=0 departing=0 pending_slots=0 ever_sealed=true

`joins_in_flight = 0` and `pending_slots = 0` ⇒ `joining` is false, so the
seal was held **purely by `missing > 0`**. Exactly 8 lanes had
`queued_frames=0 front_complete=false`, and **every one of their owners
appears in `pending_bind_pids`** — perfect correlation across three
reproductions (5-and-5, then 8-and-8, then 8-and-8).

**Root cause.** A rebinding process's lane stays `awaited` with zero
frames, so `missing > 0` and the boundary holds. But that process cannot
submit its next fire until its bind commits, and a bind commits through
the driver lane's single **control slot — downstream of the very dispatch
the boundary is holding**. Cycle closed: `bind → dispatch → seal → bind`.
The frame quorum's wait is infinite by design ("membership changes only
through close/leave/first-fire events"), so nothing ever breaks it. 19
lanes had complete frames ready, nothing was executing, and 8 binds stayed
pending for 30+ s.

`on_bind_enqueued`'s own doc-comment describes this exact hazard for the
*staged* path and dismisses it with "a live rebinder is already wait-set-held
through its lane". **That sentence was the bug** — being wait-set-held is
precisely what deadlocks it.

**Fix (first cut, superseded — see below).** In `plan_dispatch`'s `missing`
predicate, exclude a lane that is **empty** *and* whose owner has a bind in
flight. Narrowed to empty lanes on purpose: a lane with queued frames is
genuinely mid-submission and must still be waited for, so no submitted work
is ever dropped from an epoch. Rejoin is implicit — the lane's next accepted
fire restores it to the quorum. Chosen over mutating membership inside
`on_bind_enqueued` because the declarative predicate covers **both** event
orderings (bind-then-drain and drain-then-bind) and cannot accidentally
re-`staged` a live process.

**That first cut closed the deadlock but cost up to 16% throughput.** It
applied the exclusion on *every* gather, so a healthy boundary stopped
waiting for lanes that were about to rejoin and sealed a thinner epoch.
Caught by the full-matrix rerun (§20.5): pie's roomy decode-heavy cells lost
5-16% while vLLM — the control, same machine, same session — reproduced to
within 0.3%, which ruled out drift.

**Fix (shipped): gate the escape on the deadlock shape itself.** The
predicate now counts `missing` densely (pre-fix semantics) and separately
counts `missing_rebind`, the subset that is empty-with-a-bind-in-flight. The
rebinders are released only when **all** of:

* `missing == missing_rebind` — every remaining member is an empty rebinder,
* `!executing` — nothing is in flight, so no retirement will free the
  driver-lane control slot the binds need (while an epoch executes the cycle
  cannot close, and the pre-existing `return Park` already covers it),
* `!joining`, and
* the stall has persisted `REBIND_ESCAPE_US` (2 ms).

A healthy gather resolves in microseconds and never reaches the grace, so it
keeps the dense wait-all path; only the deadlock shape pays, and it pays 2 ms
once. `PIE_FRAME_REBIND_ESCAPE` selects `0` (never escape — reproduces the
deadlock), `1` (the unconditional first cut), `2` (default).

**A/B, one binary, interleaved trials** (so thermal/clock drift hits every
arm equally), pie tok/s, median of 3:

| cell | mode 0 (pre-fix) | mode 1 (uncond.) | mode 2 (shipped) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D X=0.5 | 10378 | 8731 (**0.841**) | 10577 (**1.019**) |
| D X=2   | 7212  | 6787 (0.941)     | 6990 (0.969)     |
| D X=32  | 900   | —                | 900 (0.998)      |
| S X=0.5 | 15310 | 13475            | 15714 (1.026)    |
| X X=0.5 | 4380  | —                | 4466 (1.020)     |
| M X=1   | 9350  | —                | 10501 (1.123)    |

Mode 2 is neutral-to-positive against the pre-fix engine on every cell
measured. It also removed a **starvation** side effect of mode 1: the
`allshared_noswap` probe served `12/128 completed, 116 failed` under mode 1
and `128/128, 0 failed` under mode 2 — the thinner epochs were driving the
fleet into the starvation kill.

**Test.** `an_empty_lane_awaiting_its_own_rebind_does_not_hold_the_seal` in
`frame.rs`'s `mod tests`; asserts the seal proceeds without the rebinder
*and* that the exclusion is scoped to the bind (once it commits the lane
holds the boundary again). Red under mode 0, green under modes 1 and 2 —
the toggle makes the regression test self-verifying.

**Considered and deliberately not covered:** a lane with *queued* frames
whose front is incomplete (a frame declares `stamp.fires = N` and only
`k < N` have arrived) whose owner is simultaneously mid-bind. That would
close the same cycle through a non-empty lane. It is left waited-for
because (a) all three reproductions showed the stalled lanes at
`queued_frames = 0`, matching `pending_binds` exactly, (b) excluding a
partially-submitted lane would drop *already submitted* fires out of the
epoch, which is a density and ordering regression, and (c) the strict
watchdog is the existing backstop for a genuinely stuck partial frame.
Both bind sites (`FrameTruncate`, `RegisterChannelsBind` in `worker.rs`)
are whole-turn control ops, so a guest reaching them mid-frame would need
to interleave a bind between fires of one declared frame.

**Live verification.** 44 consecutive repro runs, all
`4096/4096 failed=0`, zero `[frame-stall]` traces, throughput
3700-3999 tok/s (σ ≈ 55). Against the ~10% pre-fix wedge rate that is
`0.9^44 ≈ 0.9%` — i.e. >99% confidence the cycle is closed.

### §20.4 Instrumentation kept

All three defects were only diagnosable because of trace-gated dumps added
during the hunt; all are bounded and all are kept:

* `PlannerDiagnostics.runners` — the admitted-but-unparked cohort as
  `(seq, held_pages, progressed)`, capped at `RUNNER_DUMP_CAP = 24`. This
  is what proved the pool was fully held by *runnable* processes rather
  than leaked. Computed outside the planner lock (lock order is
  `RESIDENCIES` → KV store → `planner.inner`).
* `salvages_total`, `admitted` in `[planner-trace]`.
* `[frame-stall]` — `debug_summary()` printed once per strict-watchdog
  expiry, gated on `planner::trace_enabled()`, now including
  `pending_bind_pids`. The `pending_binds` ∩ zero-frame-lanes correlation
  is the whole proof of §20.3.

### §20.4b Two more benchmarking traps (cf. §18.11)

* **Never touch a Rust source while a soak is running.** `pie_bench.py`'s
  `embedded_engine_identity()` hard-fails when the embedded `.so` is older
  than *any* file under `driver/`, `interface/`, `runtime/`,
  `sdk/python-server/src/` with a `.rs/.c/.cc/.cpp/.cu/.cuh/.h/.hpp`
  suffix. It does not care that the edit was a comment or a `rustfmt`
  reflow, and it does not care that `git stash push` / `stash pop` only
  restored the file — the mtime moved. This silently converted two 20-run
  soaks into 20 one-second failures. Markdown is exempt, so the ledger can
  be written mid-run.
* **`tests/inferlets/text-completion-bench/target` is a load-bearing
  symlink**, not build litter. It points at the shared
  `tests/inferlets/target` holding the prebuilt
  `wasm32-wasip2/release/text_completion_bench.wasm`; `PIE_BENCH_INFERLET_DIR`
  resolves through it. Deleting it as "untracked junk" makes every bench
  run die in `bench_inferlet_paths`.

### §20.4c Throughput regression gate

Three representative matrix cells re-run on the fixed tree, 2 trials each,
against the §20.5 baseline ledger:

| cell | pages/conc | baseline pie | all four fixes (2 trials) | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S X=1.0 | 396/64 | 11062, 256/256 | 10495, 11291 (μ 10893) | in band |
| D X=32 | 69/64 | 867, **255**/256 | 882, 881 (μ 882) | in band, **256/256** |
| X X=32 | 97/64 | 556, **255**/256 | 551, 568 (μ 560) | in band, **256/256** |

Both X=32 cells now complete every request — the §20.2 salvage holding on
hardware. No cell regressed; neither the §20.3 seal exclusion nor the
§20.6 victim block costs measurable epoch density.

Final state: **349 lib + 45 integration** tests green; 14/14 probes with no
hang and no livelock; 56 cumulative clean runs of the §20.3 deadlock
repro. rustfmt diff counts at their pre-campaign baselines (`planner.rs` 7,
`planner/exec.rs` 2, `frame.rs` 0, `bootstrap.rs` 0).

Probe suite, start of campaign → end (completions / failures / wall):

| probe | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| noswap_4x | HUNG 150 s | 27ok/101f 4.5 s |
| noswap_16x | HUNG 150 s | 7ok/121f 3.9 s |
| tinyswap | HUNG 150 s | 16ok/112f 4.3 s |
| allshared_noswap | HUNG 150 s | 12ok/116f 3.9 s |
| churn_extreme | 2284ok/**1812f** 185 s | **4096ok/0f** 48 s |
| the other 9 | pass | pass, in band |

### §20.6 Defect 4 — the host-swap eviction livelock

Found by re-running the probe suite *after* the first three fixes: the
`tinyswap` probe (`--total-pages 64 --swap-pool-size 8`, 128 requests,
conc 64) went from 4 s to **152.7 s** and served 6 requests instead of 12.
The trace named it immediately:

    parks=1202800 serves=73 evictions=2 evict_rollbacks=1203865
    gate_parks=1203560 starved=110 resident=10 evicting=1 admitted=12

`evict_rollbacks` past **1.2 million** and climbing ~3.5k per interval
while `serves` and `starved` were frozen. The `planner-exec` step trace
carried **4,832,808** lines, all one pid:

    pid=20e7768e evict start: 1 working set(s)
    pid=20e7768e evict drained; quiescing leases
    pid=20e7768e evict quiesced; preparing
    pid=20e7768e evict rollback: host swap full      (×1.2M, ~7.5k/s)

**Root cause.** `KvStoreError::HostSwapFull` routed to `eviction_failed`,
which restores the victim to `Resident` and immediately `poke()`s. Victim
selection is a *deterministic* FCFS scan, so the replan re-picks the same
process and re-runs the entire fence-raise → `notify_process_suspend` →
drain → lease-quiesce → `prepare_suspend` cycle only to fail identically.
Nothing in the loop changes any input to the decision, which is the
definition of a livelock. It also churned the frame policy through
`notify_process_suspend` 7.5k times a second.

Worse, it *disarmed* the rung that would have broken the jam: a
perpetually in-flight eviction keeps `is_wedged()` false, and
`last_resort_evict` kept reporting success (it did dispatch an eviction —
which then rolled back), so `check_starvation` returned without killing
and `starved` never advanced. Same shape as §20.1: a spurious "someone is
making progress" signal.

**Fix.** `Inner::host_swap_blocked: HashSet<ProcessId>`. `HostSwapFull`
routes to a new `eviction_failed_host_swap_full`, which parks the victim
there. Both victim scans consult it:

* `victim_set()` — the routine path, and
* **`last_resort_evict`'s own inline legal-victim scan** — a *separate*
  scan built under the KV lock. Missing this one is why the first attempt
  at the fix still livelocked in 2 of 8 runs with `swapfull=1012663`: the
  block was being set and the routine path did skip it, but the endgame
  rung re-picked the blocked victim anyway. E6 hysteresis is deliberately
  waived in that scan; a host-swap block must NOT be, because it is a
  physical impossibility rather than a preference.

The poke is kept, so a *smaller* victim that still fits can be tried.
Blocks clear wholesale when host room actually returns — `report_restored`
(H2D returns slots) and `unregister` (teardown). When the block empties the
legal set, `last_resort_evict` returns false and `check_starvation`
proceeds to the kill: failing one request loudly is the designed terminal
behaviour, and it is strictly better than spinning forever.

**Test.** `a_host_swap_full_victim_is_parked_until_host_room_returns` in
`mod starvation_race_tests` — asserts the blocked victim leaves
`victim_set()` and that clearing re-arms it. Red before, green after.

**Live.** `tinyswap` 12/12 runs at **3.7-4.6 s** (was 152.7 s), 11-22
completions (was 4-6 livelocked, 12 pre-campaign). Two of the twelve
engaged the new path and it **bounded them at 28 and 13 rollbacks** rather
than 1,000,000+. `planner-exec` lines 4,832,808 → 22. New trace field
`swapfull=<exhaustions>/<unblocks>`.

**Methodological note.** This defect was only visible because the probe
suite was re-run end-to-end after the earlier fixes. Defects 1-3 each
changed which liveness signals are trusted, and that shifted `tinyswap`
from "killed fast by the starvation rung" into the eviction-retry path
where the pre-existing spin lived. Re-run the whole suite after every
liveness change, not just the probes that were failing.

### §20.5 Standing comparison and the open findings

Final 40-cell parity matrix on the shipped engine (`PIE_FRAME_REBIND_ESCAPE`
default 2). pie legs re-measured in `/root/matrix_m2`; vLLM legs reused from
`/root/matrix_fixed` — page counts reproduce exactly and vLLM's whole D
column re-measured to within 0.3%, which is what licensed the reuse.

Throughput ratio pie/vLLM, `X = concurrency * (prompt + max_tokens) / (16P)`:

| shape | X=0.5 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S (short)   | **1.043** | 0.931 | 0.866 | 0.815 | 0.839 | 0.816 | 0.858 | 0.807 |
| D (decode)  | 0.950 | 0.945 | 0.752 | 0.763 | 0.769 | 0.772 | 0.775 | vLLM died |
| M (mixed)   | 0.978 | 0.872 | 0.782 | 0.809 | 0.816 | 0.841 | 0.867 | vLLM died |
| X (extreme) | 0.837 | 0.821 | 0.747 | 0.813 | 0.896 | 0.934 | 0.888 | vLLM died |

`N=29 min=0.747 p50=0.837 max=1.043 mean=0.848`. Against the same cells
before §20.3's regression fix the roomy corner moved from 0.809-0.879 to
0.950-1.043; nothing moved backwards. The campaign produced exactly one
performance regression, its own (§20.3), and that one is closed.

**X=64 is where the comparison stops being a comparison.** At 64x
oversubscription vLLM was SIGKILLed at the case deadline in 4 of the 5
shapes while pie completed every one of them, shedding load through the
starvation rung instead of wedging. pie's X=64 numbers have no denominator.

| tput, conc 256  | 22295 | 29664 | 0.752 |

pie leads on both latency and throughput up to 64 concurrent processes and
falls behind past it. Note these numbers are only meaningful because the
planner trace was OFF on both engines — see §20.4b, it costs 2.08x.

**Open finding: pie stops pipelining above 64 concurrent processes.**
Duty cycle = `total_batches * avg_batch_latency_us / measured_seconds`, i.e.
how many forward batches are in flight on average:

| conc | batches | avg batch us | duty | batch size hist |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32  | 2048 | 5921 | **1.77** | all 2048 at 32 |
| 64  | 1025 | 6987 | **1.69** | 1023 at 64 |
| 128 | 518  | 7376 | **1.00** | 506 at 128 |
| 256 | 516  | 12042 | **0.94** | 512 at 256 |

Batches are *full* at every point, so this is not a batching-density
problem — pie simply stops overlapping batches exactly where it starts
losing to vLLM. A batch of 128 also costs barely more than a batch of 64
(7376 vs 6987 us), so the GPU is not the limit either; recovering the 1.7x
overlap at conc 128 would roughly double throughput there.

This is **not** a contention defect and **not** a regression from this
campaign: `PIE_FRAME_REBIND_ESCAPE=0` (pre-§20.3 behaviour) shows the same
collapse (duty 0.98/0.96 at conc 128, 0.96/1.12 at 256), and the planner is
completely idle in these runs (`evictions=starved=parks=restores=0`). It
lives in the fire/quorum path, not in Rainer.

**Open finding (not a defect, a design gap): pie has no KV-aware admission
control.** pie admits by *process count*; vLLM admits by *KV block
availability* with a WAITING queue and will simply not start a request it
cannot fund. At a fixed 96 pages:

| engine | concurrency | result |
|---|---|---|
| pie | 1024 | 238 tok/s, 1852 timeouts |
| pie | 256 | 4290 tok/s, 4096/4096 |
| pie | 1024, 900 s deadline | 3789 tok/s, 4096/4096 |
| vLLM | 1024 | 5596 tok/s, 4096/4096 |

The engine is sound — the work completes — but with concurrency far above
what the pool can fund, pie spreads the pool thin and pays it entirely in
tail latency, where vLLM converts the same oversubscription into queueing.
Admission that consults free KV (rather than only
`max_concurrent_processes`) is the natural follow-up and is the single
largest remaining gap this campaign found.

### §20.7 The scenario suite moved into the tree (2026-07-27)

Everything this campaign used as a one-off probe now lives in
`tests/contention/` as a declarative table plus a runner:

    python tests/contention/run.py                  # every scenario
    python tests/contention/run.py -k tinyswap,soak # a subset
    python tests/contention/run.py --repeat 3       # override repetition
    python tests/contention/run.py --list

Each scenario names the planner endgame path it aims at and carries a
`Contract`: a wall-clock ceiling (exceeding it is a hang), completion and
failure bounds, `accounted` (completed + failed == requests, so nothing
vanishes), `require_counters` (planner counters that must be non-zero, so a
scenario cannot rot into a no-op when policy shifts underneath it),
`max_counters` (this is how §20.6's 1.2M-rollback livelock is
regression-tested) and forbidden log substrings (`[frame-stall]` is §20.3's
tell). The exit status is non-zero if anything violates its contract, so it
drops straight into the `[self-hosted, cuda]` CI job.

Every scenario drives a **real** driver. There is no mock device anywhere in
the suite, by design: all five defects lived in the interaction between the
planner, the scheduler's frame boundary and the driver's copy engine, and a
mock device reproduces none of it.

Four things the first end-to-end run taught, all now encoded:

* the runner has to put a **working** CUDA forward-compat directory on
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or the driver aborts with `pie_cuda_create returned
  null`. Taking the highest-versioned `/usr/local/cuda-*/compat` is wrong on
  a box carrying a toolkit newer than the kernel driver's ceiling — 13.3's
  libcuda 610.43.02 loads happily and then fails `cuInit` against a 550
  kernel module. The runner probes `cuInit` per candidate and takes the
  first that actually initialises.
* `PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS` must be well under the shortest scenario's
  runtime. The fast-fail scenarios finish in 0.9 s, so at the original
  1000 ms sampling period **not one trace line was ever emitted** and every
  `require_counters` assertion reported "never fired" — a false failure that
  reads exactly like a real regression. The default is now 200 ms, and "no
  trace line at all" is reported as its own distinct violation.
* the prefix-sharing scenarios need `warmup=1`. Without a warmup request
  nothing has published the shared prefix, so all 128 processes arrive with
  a private copy of it and the fleet starves on arrival instead of
  exercising `ReclaimQuote -> Nothing(AllShared)`.
* a contract has to be calibrated against the defect it claims to guard, not
  guessed. `tinyswap` at the original 64 pages / 8 swap pages never reached
  `HostSwapFull` at all — the starvation rung killed the fleet first and
  `swapfull` stayed 0. Re-sized to 128/16 at concurrency 16 it fires 10-58
  swap-full hits on every run while the fleet still finishes 61-63 of 64.
  Conversely `allshared_noswap` cannot gate on completion counts: measured
  four runs per mode, `PIE_FRAME_REBIND_ESCAPE=1` completes 16-24 and mode 2
  completes 31-59, distributions that touch. That scenario asserts liveness
  only and §20.3's A/B harness pins the mode difference instead.

### §20.8 `PIE_FRAME_SIZE=2` buys the high-concurrency gap back — and breaks contention liveness (2026-07-27)

§20.5's open finding was that pie stops overlapping batches above 64
concurrent processes. The frame constant k (`PIE_FRAME_SIZE`, waves per
frame, default 1, driver-supported to 4) is the direct lever: at k = 1 the
wait-all quorum runs once per token, so every lane must arrive before any
lane advances.

Uncontended, Qwen3-0.6B, 4096 pages, interleaved arms, best of two trials:

| case | pie k=1 | pie k=2 | vLLM | k1/vLLM | k2/vLLM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| latency, conc 1 | 397 | 395 | 371 | 1.069 | 1.066 |
| tput, conc 1   | 409 | 399 | 372 | 1.098 | 1.072 |
| tput, conc 8   | 2853 | 2873 | 2668 | 1.069 | 1.077 |
| tput, conc 32  | 9650 | 9701 | 9399 | 1.027 | 1.032 |
| tput, conc 64  | 15642 | 15675 | 15542 | 1.006 | 1.009 |
| tput, conc 128 | 21656 | 22132 | 23199 | 0.933 | 0.954 |
| tput, conc 256 | 21670 | **27955** | 29928 | 0.724 | **0.934** |

k = 2 costs nothing anywhere and recovers most of the conc-256 gap
(0.724 -> 0.934), with mean latency there falling 2408 -> 1748 ms. The
mechanism is exactly the one §20.5 identified: duty (batches in flight)
goes from a bimodal 0.80-1.33 at k = 1 to a stable 1.59-1.60 at k = 2.
**k = 1 at conc 256 is not merely slower, it is unstable** — it drops out
of pipelining entirely on roughly half the runs. k = 4 measured the same as
k = 2, and raising `PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` 2 -> 3 changed nothing (the
run-ahead depth was never the binding constraint).

**But k = 2 is not contention-safe.** `tests/contention/run.py` under
`PIE_FRAME_SIZE=2`: **12 of 16 scenarios fail**, against 16/16 at k = 1.

| outcome | scenarios |
|---|---|
| HANG (killed at the ceiling) | `tinyswap` 3/3, `tinyswap_thrash`, `impossible`, `fwd1` |
| **SIGSEGV** (rc = -11) | `mixed_head`, `soak` |
| `[frame-stall]` + mass failure | `restore1` (9/256 completed) |
| degraded | `hog` 0/32, `onefits` 25/64, `churn` 2047/2048 in 181 s (44 s at k = 1) |
| pass | `noswap_4x`, `noswap_16x`, `allshared`, `allshared_noswap`, `churn_extreme` 4/4, `admission_tail` |

The split is perfectly explained by eviction volume. Everything that passes
does 0 or 1 evictions; everything that fails evicts continuously
(`restore1` 33, `onefits` 36, `tinyswap` 5, `soak` 47).

Root cause, read straight off the diagnostic — 11 of 12 lanes complete, one
not:

    [frame-stall] frame k=2 lanes=12 awaited=12 sealed=0 ... ever_sealed=true
      lane ...0004 awaited=true queued_frames=1 front_complete=true
      lane ...000b awaited=true queued_frames=1 front_complete=false   <- owner c96a0ef8
      ... (ten more, all front_complete=true)
    [planner-trace] ... evictions=33 gate_parks=33 evicting=1 evicted=15

and for that same owner:

    [planner-exec] pid=c96a0ef8... evict start: 1 working set(s)
    [planner-exec] pid=c96a0ef8... evict drained; quiescing leases

**The planner quiesces a lane mid-frame.** At k = 1 a fire *is* a frame, so
a park/evict boundary is a frame boundary by construction and the wait-all
gate can never see a half-arrived frame. At k > 1 an eviction that lands
between slot 0 and slot 1 leaves the lane's frame permanently
arrival-incomplete, and the infinite wait-all rule then holds the entire
epoch behind it — the same failure shape as §20.3's rebind/frame-seal
deadlock, but reached through the eviction path instead of the bind path,
and not covered by that fix's escape (which keys on empty lanes awaiting
their own rebind, whereas here the lane is non-empty and half-full).

The two SIGSEGVs are a separate, harder failure: `mixed_head` and `soak`
die with no panic message, i.e. in native driver code, which the
half-drained frame state is presumably feeding.

#### Defect 5 — a partial frame stranded by a mid-frame leave (FIXED)

Two coupled faults, both invisible at k = 1 because a 1-slot frame is
complete the instant it arrives:

**5a — an arrival racing the suspend rejoined the wait-set.**
`planner/exec.rs` broadcasts `notify_process_suspend` at evict step 3, and
the fence raised at step 2 stops new *leases*, not a fire already past it.
`record_arrival`'s `lanes.entry(...).or_insert_with(|| LaneState { awaited:
true, .. })` therefore recreated the victim's lane as an awaited member
holding a one-slot-of-two frame whose remaining slots sat behind the
eviction. Fix: `FramePolicy::suspended`, a set the planner's suspend adds
to and its runnable-again chokepoints (`report_restored`,
`eviction_failed_inner`) clear through the new
`worker::notify_process_resume` / `SchedulerItem::ProcessResume` /
`FramePolicy::on_process_resume`. While marked, arrivals are recorded
without joining the wait-set.

**5b — the stranded slot never sealed, so its lease never released.**
Un-awaiting the lane unblocks the *fleet*, but the victim's own half-frame
still could not seal, and a queued fire holds a lease. Eviction step 5
(`handle.quiesce().await`) waits on exactly those leases, so the eviction
wedged mid-flight — `evicting=1` forever, the planner head stuck on
`head_kind=allocation`, and the whole fleet starving behind it. The same
circle is reachable with no planner at all: the KV allocation-wait park
posts a lane close mid-frame, and the guest cannot finish the frame until
it is served, which needs the fleet to advance, which the frame blocks.

Fix: `LaneState`/`FramePolicy::truncate_incomplete` — every path that takes
a lane out of the wait-set mid-frame (`on_lane_leave` non-purging,
`on_process_suspend`) now cuts its unfinished frames down to what ARRIVED,
so they seal, drain and release their leases. Arrivals under a suspended
owner are self-completing for the same reason. The slots the cut discarded
may still arrive (the guest resumes inside its submit loop), so
`FramePolicy::truncated_seqs` remembers the cut seq per lane — kept outside
`lanes` because a truncated lane is normally dropped the moment its frames
drain, well before the late slot lands — and a late slot stands alone
instead of re-forming an unsatisfiable frame. `PendingFrame::truncated`
keeps `expected` from being re-raised by a later slot's `stamp.fires`.

Also fixed in `pipeline/fire.rs`: the mid-frame truncation notice was only
sent on the *logical* submit-error path; a host trap returned through `?`
and left the frame arrival-incomplete forever.

Regression tests: `a_fire_racing_the_suspend_seals_alone_without_rejoining_the_wait_set`
and `a_lane_parked_mid_frame_seals_what_it_submitted` (`scheduler/frame.rs`).

#### Post-fix: k = 2 is contention-clean, and k = 3/4 buy nothing

`tests/contention/run.py` after the fix: **16/16 at k = 1, 2, 3 and 4**
(from 12 failures at k = 2 before). `churn` returned to 43 s from 181 s.

Uncontended sweep, best of two trials:

| case | k=1 | k=2 | k=3 | k=4 | k2/k1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| lat, conc 1 | 396 | 410 | 412 | 409 | 1.036 |
| tput, conc 8 | 2835 | 2865 | 2871 | 2884 | 1.011 |
| tput, conc 32 | 9648 | 9654 | 9624 | 9657 | 1.001 |
| tput, conc 64 | 15499 | 15629 | 15486 | 15508 | 1.008 |
| tput, conc 128 | 21776 | 22042 | 22052 | 21960 | 1.012 |
| tput, conc 256 | 21767 | **28050** | 27899 | 27615 | **1.289** |

k = 3 and k = 4 are indistinguishable from k = 2 (0.98–1.00 of it) while
costing more staging depth and a coarser truncation granularity under
contention, so **k = 2 is the setting**: the whole win is the duty cycle
(conc 256: 1.12 -> 1.62; conc 128: the bimodal 1.00/1.67 collapses to a
stable 1.67), which is what §20.5's open finding predicted. Mean latency at
conc 256 falls 3746 -> 2918 ms. `PIE_FRAME_SIZE` default raised 1 -> 2.

Final parity against vLLM 0.26.0 on the shipped default, interleaved arms,
best of two trials (4096 pages both sides):

| case | pie k=1 | pie k=2 | vLLM | k1/vLLM | k2/vLLM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| latency, conc 1 | 411 | 399 | 370 | 1.110 | 1.077 |
| tput, conc 1 | 409 | 401 | 372 | 1.101 | 1.079 |
| tput, conc 8 | 2823 | 2867 | 2669 | 1.058 | 1.074 |
| tput, conc 32 | 9614 | 9701 | 9609 | 1.001 | 1.010 |
| tput, conc 64 | 15663 | 15782 | 15619 | 1.003 | 1.010 |
| tput, conc 128 | 21646 | 22084 | 22820 | 0.949 | 0.968 |
| tput, conc 256 | 27110 | 28061 | 29664 | 0.914 | 0.946 |

pie is ahead of vLLM at concurrency 1–64 and within 3–5% at 128/256 (from
7%/28% behind). Note that k = 1 landed in its GOOD mode at conc 256 here
(27110) where the sweep above caught its bad mode (21767): k = 1 is
bimodal at that point and k = 2 is not — the run-to-run spread is the
reason to take the default, independent of the mean.

## §20.9 The settlement callback sat on the compute stream (2026-07-28)

### Question

With `PIE_FRAME_SIZE=2` the decode pipeline should be perfectly covered:
frame *N+1* is submitted while frame *N* runs, the sampled token carries over
**on device** through the channel, and no host round trip separates the two
forward passes. Yet uncontended conc 256 still trailed vLLM by 3–7%, and
raising *k* to 3 or 4 changed nothing. Why?

Steady-state cycle, two-point `(wall@256tok − wall@128tok)/128`, 12288 pages,
conc 256:

| engine | cycle |
| ------ | ----- |
| pie k=1 | 13.835 ms |
| pie k=2 | 13.407 ms |
| vLLM    | 12.946 ms |

k=2 is 1.036× vLLM, i.e. **+461 µs per wave** to account for.

### First diagnosis — wrong

`PIE_FIRE_TIMING=1` puts p50 host work at 1525 µs/wave, of which FrameSettle
is 859 µs and `finish_epilogue` 709 µs (execute 286 / group 279 / assemble
71). Tempting, but wrong: NVTX shows that work starting *mid* graph replay and
the submitting thread idle ~70% of the wall. It is not GPU-visible. Rejecting
it is what forced the real answer out.

### Evidence chain

Against a conc-256 k=2 nsys capture (`--cuda-graph-trace`, KERNEL ∪ MEMCPY ∪
MEMSET ∪ GRAPH_TRACE merged — omitting any of those tables manufactures fake
idle):

1. The wave is 8205 µs: 7476 µs graph replay (91.1%) + 382 µs non-graph
   device + **347 µs idle**. The single largest idle window sits between
   `k_settle_host_channels_batch` and the next wave's
   `k_pull_validate_host_channels_batch`, p50 224 µs.
2. Not starvation. In 284 of 290 steady gaps the next wave's
   `k_pull_validate` had *already been submitted*, p50 8673 µs **before** the
   GPU went idle.
3. Genuinely idle, not misattributed: p50 busy inside the window is 8.9 µs of
   224.2 µs.
4. Not a cross-stream wait. `STREAM_WAIT_EVENT` totals 1.1 µs over the whole
   window set, and the last op on any non-main stream ends p50 2360 µs before
   the window closes.
5. **Zero host CUDA API calls occur during the window.** Whatever holds the
   stream makes no CUDA calls — a driver-internal thread.
6. Scaling control at conc 32 vs 256: 124.8 µs vs 224.2 µs, i.e.
   **gap = 111 µs + 0.44 µs × lanes**.

### Root cause

`dispatch.cu` enqueued the settlement notification on the **compute stream**:

```
:4942  cudaStream_t callback_stream = stream;
:5088  cudaStream_t settlement_stream = callback_stream;   // batch_copies == false here
:5161  cudaLaunchHostFunc(settlement_stream, notify_runtime_callback, notify);
```

A host-function node holds its stream until the CUDA driver's callback thread
wakes on the CPU and returns. Everything queued behind it — including the
already-submitted next wave — cannot start. The 111 µs constant is the
callback-thread wakeup; the 0.44 µs/lane term is `notify_runtime_callback`
releasing each instance's `callback_fence`.

This is precisely why *k* never helped: **k pre-queues wave N+1 behind the
blocking node**, and a blocking node cannot be jumped by pre-queueing. k=2,
3 and 4 all measured the same because they were all waiting on the same CPU
thread.

### Fix

Move the host function to a dedicated `notify_stream`:

* record `settlement_ready` on the settlement stream after
  `launch_settle_host_channels_batch`, have `notify_stream` wait on it, and
  launch `cudaLaunchHostFunc` there;
* record both `notify->callback_done` and a new
  `settlement_callbacks_done` on `notify_stream`.

One hazard has to be handled. `commit_snapshot()` pools pinned host buffers
per **(BoundInstance, occurrence-within-wave)** and reuses them every wave, so
wave *N+1*'s D2H publications write the very buffers wave *N*'s callback
reads. The on-compute-stream host func was providing that barrier by accident.
It is restored explicitly with a `cudaStreamWaitEvent` on
`settlement_callbacks_done` placed immediately **before** this wave's
`enqueue_host_publish_copies` — a full forward pass downstream of the record,
so it never blocks in the covered case, and no cycle is possible because the
awaited record is always from a strictly earlier wave (`Dispatch::finish` is
serialized by `settlement_mutex`). `NotifyContextLease` now drains
`notify_stream` on the exception path as well.

### Result (conc 256 unless noted, 4–8 trials each)

| case | before | after | Δ |
| ---- | ------ | ----- | - |
| conc 64, k=1 | 15634 | 16243 | +3.9% |
| conc 64, k=2 | 15758 | 16145 | +2.5% |
| conc 256, k=2 | 27866 | **28497** | +2.3% |
| conc 256, k=1 fast mode | 26981 | **28656** | +6.2% |
| steady cycle vs vLLM | 1.0356× | **1.0154×** | gap halved |

k=2 at conc 256 is now 8/8 trials inside 1% (28371–28656) against a vLLM
reference of 29621–29688, i.e. 0.962× on throughput where it was 0.937×.
Contention suite: 16/16.

## §20.10 Why k=1 at conc 256 is multimodal (2026-07-28)

k=1 lands anywhere in 18.8-29.0 k tok/s across process launches while k=2 does
not. Ruled out first, all measured, none of them the cause:

* **GPU clocks** — SM clock pinned at 2520 MHz in every mode, no throttle
  reason asserted, temp <= 44 C.
* **NUMA** — the GPU is local to node 1, but `taskset` onto node 1 *or* node 0
  is equally multimodal.
* **Host CPU frequency** — schedutil governor, but max / 8th / median core MHz
  are identical (3250 / 2846 / 1500) in fast and slow runs.
* **External contention** — GPU empty (1 MiB), load ~11 on 128 cores.
* **Engine decisions** — memory planner output, 51 captured decode graphs,
  batch count, batch-size histogram, `max forward requests: 256`, prompt and
  output token counts are all identical across modes.

### It is duty, and duty is quantised

Duty = mean forward batches in flight = `avg batch latency / (wall / batches)`.
Measured (conc 256, 12288-page-equivalent budget, 8 trials per arm):

| arm | duty | tok/s |
| --- | ---- | ----- |
| k=2 (default), 8/8 | 1.56-1.60 | 28371-28656 |
| k=1, fast | 1.54-1.58 | 26.8-29.0 k |
| k=1, mid | 1.09-1.11 | 21.4-22.2 k |
| k=1, slow | 0.82-0.85 | 18.7-18.8 k |
| k=1 with `PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT=1` | 0.84-0.85 | 19.8-20.2 k |

Two things follow immediately.

**k does not create the overlap.** A healthy k=1 run reaches duty 1.58 — the
same as k=2. Frame overlap is structural and k-independent: `FramePolicy`
seals the next frame the moment the wait-all gate holds, normally while the
current frame is still executing, and posts its waves behind the executing
frame's tail at the run-ahead depth. There is no launch-time barrier; the
driver's device-side `pass_commit` tickets order dependent fires by stream
order and a frame-boundary dependency is structurally identical to an
intra-frame one. What k changes is how *often* the wait-all seal boundary
occurs (once per k waves) and therefore how much GPU time is available to
cover one host turn.

**The slow mode is the run-ahead collapsing, not extra work.** Forcing
`PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT=1` reproduces the slowest mode exactly and, unlike
the default, *stably* (sigma = 220 tok/s). Depth 3 does not help: the cap is
not the limiter, arrival into the seal window is.

### The mode is per COHORT, not per run

512 requests at concurrency 256 is two cohorts of 256. Splitting each run in
half (`cohort1 = 2*lat_mean - wall`):

```
k=1 fixed  28586 tok/s   cohort1 30.4k   cohort2 27.0k     fast, fast
k=1 fixed  22225 tok/s   cohort1 29.5k   cohort2 17.8k     fast, slow
k=1 fixed  22156 tok/s   cohort1 18.2k   cohort2 28.2k     slow, fast
k=1 fixed  18779 tok/s   cohort1 18.2k   cohort2 19.4k     slow, slow
k=2 fixed  (8 runs)      every cohort 28.0-29.0k
```

Each 256-process cohort independently settles into duty ~1.58 or ~0.83 when it
forms, holds it for all 128 of its decode waves, and the run-level modes are
just the two combinations: 28.5 k (fast+fast), ~22 k (mixed), 18.8 k
(slow+slow). Matching duty levels 1.58 / 1.10 / 0.83 confirm the arithmetic.
k=2 never collapses in any of its 16 observed cohorts.

### Where the stall is

nsys on a k=1 run, merged device-op gaps above 200 us by bracketing operation:

```
258  786 ms  avg 3046 us   k_settle_host_channels_batch -> MEMCPY
149  461 ms  avg 3097 us   MEMCPY -> MEMCPY
143   53 ms  avg  371 us   MEMCPY -> embed_bf16_kernel
```

258 is exactly the batch count: the stall is at the seal boundary, between one
frame's settlement and the next frame's H2D upload. The idle *immediately*
before a wave's `k_pull_validate` is p50 1.4 us, so nothing is waiting on
batch construction once the frame has been sealed — the wait is for the seal.

The seal is wait-for-ALL: it holds until every awaited lane's oldest queued
frame is arrival-complete, so the binding term is the **slowest of 256** lanes'
resubmit each frame. At k=1 that maximum is paid once per wave and has one
wave of GPU time (~7.1 ms) to hide behind; at k=2 it is paid half as often and
has two waves (~14.9 ms). The absolute cost of the turn scales with lane count,
not with k — which is why k=2 is comfortably covered and k=1 sits on the edge.

Two levers confirm the turn is the term that varies:

* **Any added host cost pins k=1 slow.** `PIE_FIRE_TIMING=1` (65 664 per-fire
  JSON records) parks it at 14.9-15.8 k, 4/4; nsys parks it at 17.0-21.7 k,
  4/4. Neither perturbs k=2 comparably.
* **Tokio worker count moves it.** conc 256, k=1, 4 trials each:
  `--worker-threads 8` -> 27100/27084/26664/23177; `32` ->
  18987/18677/19015/19079 (sigma = 179); 16 and the default 64 are multimodal.
  (`default_worker_threads()` in `worker/src/config.rs` already caps at 64 for
  exactly this class of variance on EPYC.)

### Status

**Open**: what decides a cohort's mode at formation is not yet identified. It
is not any of the environmental or planner variables above, it is stable for
the cohort's entire life, and it is independent between consecutive cohorts in
one process.

**Not on the default path.** k=2 has been the default since §20.8 precisely
because it puts the seal boundary behind two waves of cover: on the fixed
build conc 256 k=2 is 28371-28656 over 8 trials, a 1.0% spread, with no
collapsed cohort observed. The §20.9 fix raises k=1's fast mode
(26981 -> 28656, +6.2%) and leaves the collapsed mode where it was (baseline
18.9-21.7 k, fixed 18.8-22.2 k) — a strict improvement that does not remove
the bistability, because the residual stall is the seal turn rather than the
callback node. If k=1 must be used at high concurrency, `--worker-threads 8`
is the lever.

## 20.11 The k = 1 collapse was a guest window-sizing bug, not a law

§20.10 left one question open: what latches a cohort into the collapsed mode.
The answer is that nothing latches it *in the engine* — the cohort simply never
had enough queued work to absorb a straggler, and the shortfall was written
into the **guest**, not the runtime.

### The cover rule

`tests/inferlets/text-completion-bench/src/lib.rs` kept a run-ahead window of
`2 * live_slots` fires, i.e. exactly **two frames**, for every `k`. The engine's
frame seal is wait-for-ALL: it holds until every awaited lane's oldest queued
frame is arrival-complete, so the binding term is the slowest of `concurrency`
lanes' resubmit. What buys that straggler its time is the work already queued
*behind* the running frame:

```
cover_waves = window_fires - live_slots = (window_frames - 1) * k
```

A two-frame window therefore gives `k` waves of cover — **two** at k = 2, and
**one** (~7.1 ms) at k = 1. The old rule sized the window in frames, but the
quantity that has to cover a straggler is measured in waves. k = 1 was running
with a third of the cover k = 2 got, from the same line of guest code.

### Measurement (Qwen3-0.6B, L40S, conc 256, on the §20.9 build)

| arm | cover | result | median |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| k=1, `2*k` (old) | 1 wave | multimodal 18.8k / 22k / 28.5k | 25184 |
| k=1, 3 frames | 2 waves | 7/8 at 28.6-29.5k, 1/8 collapsed | 28687 |
| k=1, 4 frames | 3 waves | **6/6 at 28663-29488** | **29044** |
| k=2, `2*k` (old) | 2 waves | 8/8 at 28371-28656 | 28497 |
| k=2, cover 3 | 3 waves | 6/6 at 28217-28795 | 28654 |

Duty (mean forward batches in flight) confirms the mechanism directly: the
k = 1 window-3 arm runs at **1.72-1.74**, up from 1.58 in the healthy old-rule
runs and 0.83 in the collapsed ones. 15 of its 16 cohorts sit at 27.6-30.5k.

Two conclusions:

1. **The collapse is removable.** At three waves of cover k = 1 is unimodal
   over 6/6 trials, and its median (29044) is *above* k = 2's (28497) — a
   smaller frame with adequate cover beats a larger frame, because the seal
   quantum is finer. Against vLLM's 29621-29688 that is a ratio of 0.979,
   up from 0.961.
2. **k >= 2 was already saturated.** Giving k = 2 a third wave of cover moves
   nothing (28497 -> 28654, inside the noise), which is why the defect only
   ever showed at k = 1 and why k = 2 has been a safe default.

### Fix

The window now takes the max of two independent floors:

```rust
let window_fires = live_slots + live_slots.max(3);
```

* `>= 1 whole extra frame` — frames settle atomically, so a window shorter
  than two frames leaves zero queued frames while a k >= 2 frame runs.
* `>= 3 waves of cover` — the straggler allowance, independent of `k`.

At k = 1 this is 4 fires (was 2), at k = 2 it is 5 (was 4), and at k >= 3 the
frame floor already dominates so the value is unchanged (k = 4: 8 either way).

Verified: conc 64 k = 2 measures 16132-16200 (median 16153) against the §20.9
baseline of 16145 — no regression on the default path — and the contention
suite is 16/16.

### What this does not change

`PIE_FRAME_SIZE` stays at 2. k = 1 with a correctly sized window is marginally
faster at conc 256, but k = 2 is within 2% there, is unimodal under the *old*
guest rule as well, and costs less staging depth per lane; §20.8's reasons for
the default are untouched. The finding's real content is that **run-ahead cover
is a guest responsibility and must be sized in waves, not frames** — any
inferlet that hard-codes a frame-count window inherits this bug at k = 1.

### 20.11.1 Why the natural "two frames in flight" pattern is not enough

The old rule is the obvious pipelining discipline: submit two frames, then top
up one frame per frame that drains. It is correct in shape. What it gets wrong
is the *runway* it leaves, which is easiest to see in steady state:

* a lane holds `W = window_fires` submitted-but-undrained fires;
* a whole guest frame settles atomically, so `k` fires drain at once and the
  lane drops to `W - k` outstanding;
* those `W - k` fires are the lane's runway — `(W - k) * T_wave` of already
  queued work before the engine has nothing from this lane to seal with.

`W = 2k` therefore leaves a runway of exactly `k` waves *whatever k is*, while
the thing it has to hide — the host turnaround `H` from settlement to the
guest's next `submit_frame` — does not shrink with `k` at all. At conc 256,
`T_wave` is 8.76 ms, so k = 1 gets 8.8 ms of runway and k = 2 gets 17.5 ms.
Measured `H_max` there is 17-26 ms: k = 2 clears it by a hair, k = 1 does not.
That is the entire asymmetry.

Note also that a lane running dry is not a lane-local slowdown. The seal is
wait-for-ALL, so one dry lane stalls the whole cross-lane batch.

### 20.11.2 Guest window vs engine depth — two different "frames"

The word *frame* names two different objects and the distinction is what makes
the accounting work:

| | guest frame | engine frame (a "batch") |
| --- | --- | --- |
| what | `k` fires from ONE lane (`submit_frame`) | one guest frame from EVERY lane |
| size | `k` waves | `k` waves x N lanes |
| who caps it | the inferlet, via `window_fires` | the engine, via `configured_max_in_flight()` |

`in_flight_launches` (`scheduler/worker.rs:2105`) is a single deque in the
scheduler loop, so `configured_max_in_flight()` = 2 is a **global** cap of two
cross-lane batches posted to the driver — not a per-lane depth. Confirmed by
the batch arithmetic on 512 x 128 = 65536 output tokens at conc 256: k = 1
reports 260 batches (252 tok/batch = 256 lanes x 1 wave), k = 2 reports 130
(504 tok/batch = 256 lanes x 2 waves).

The consequence is that widening the guest window does **not** deepen the
device pipeline — the driver's depth is fixed by the engine and by
`kSchedulerMaxInFlight`/`kUploadStagingDepth`. The extra fires simply wait in
the engine's `pending` queue. That is precisely their job: what the seal gate
needs is for every lane to *have a fire queued* when it evaluates, and a lane
whose guest has not resubmitted yet has none.

### 20.11.3 Cover sweep — why 3, and the cost of more

Cover is a time budget (`cover * T_wave` must exceed `H_max`), so it was swept
against both concurrency and cover. `T_wave` is the per-wave service period,
`wall / batches / k`:

| conc | `T_wave` | cover 1 | cover 2 | cover 3 | cover 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 64 | 3.97 ms | 16357 ok | - | 16276 ok | - |
| 256 | 8.76 ms | 25184 **multimodal** | 28687 (7/8) | **29044 ok** | 28372 ok |
| 512 | 16.9 ms | 23269 **collapsed** | 30280 ok | 30256 ok | - |

Reading the failures as a time threshold: conc 64 clears at 3.97 ms of runway,
conc 256 fails at 8.8 ms and clears at 26.3 ms, conc 512 fails at 16.9 ms and
clears at 33.8 ms. So `H_max` grows with lane count but *sublinearly relative
to* `T_wave`, which grows too — and the ratio peaks in the middle. **conc 256
is the binding point**, needing 3 waves; 512 needs only 2 and 64 needs 1.

More cover is not free, which is why the constant is 3 and not 8. At conc 256
cover 6 is perfectly stable but measures 28372 against cover 3's 29044, a 2.3%
loss: a larger window reserves more KV ahead per lane (`reserve_to_tokens`
covers every submitted fire) and lengthens the queue the scheduler scans each
seal. Cover 3 is simultaneously the maximum the sweep requires and the optimum
at the point that requires it.

## §20.12 The run-ahead window belongs to the engine: `channel-capacity()` (2026-07-28)

§20.11 fixed one guest's window. This makes the fix structural: the engine
computes the window and hands it to every guest over WIT, and the SDK provides
the loop that consumes it.

### The quantity

```
R = HOST_TURNAROUND_WAVES = 3       host resubmit turnaround, k-INDEPENDENT
F = 1 + ceil(R / k)                 frames a lane keeps outstanding
W = F * k + 1                       model.channel-capacity(), in CELLS
```

| k | F | W | window (fires) | cover (waves) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| 2 | 3 | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| 3 | 2 | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| 4 | 2 | 9 | 8 | 4 |

`R` is in waves because that is what §20.10 showed the seal actually consumes:
the wait-for-ALL quorum's binding term is the slowest lane's resubmit, and a
frame does not make that turnaround any shorter. Sizing in frames is what gave
k=1 a single wave of runway from the same line of code that gave k=2 two.

The `+1` is structural, not empirical. At zero margin the producer needs the
consumer's ack to be visible at publish time, and that visibility delay *is*
the host round trip run-ahead exists to hide.

`PIE_TURNAROUND_WAVES` overrides `R`. Swept at conc 256 (Qwen3-0.6B / L40S,
medians of 3-4):

| k | R=3 | R=5 | R=6 | R=8 | R=10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **29031** | 28874 | - | 28472 | - |
| 2 | **28847** | - | 28635 | - | 28369 |

Monotonically decreasing above 3 at both frame sizes, for the reason §20.11
already gave: a deeper window reserves more KV per lane and lengthens the queue
the scheduler scans each seal. R=3 is measured, not assumed.

Larger models may want more — upstream's bench default was 6 FRAMES, tuned at
c=128 on Kimi K2.6 — which is what the env override is for.

### Why the guest cannot be trusted with it

At k=1 there is no diagnostic of any kind. `fire.rs:1217` short-circuits to
`submit_pass_stamped` before `validate_frame`, and every capacity check
(`fire.rs:1327-1406`) lives inside `validate_frame`. An undersized k=1 ring
serialises the lane silently, forever. That is exactly the §20.10 collapse, and
it took three investigations to find because nothing reported it.

### Top-up discipline (a real defect this surfaced)

Refill only while a WHOLE frame still fits:

```rust
let s = (budget - submitted).min(live_slots);
if submitted - drained + s > window_fires { break; }
```

Testing `submitted - drained < window_fires` instead lets a frame START one
below the window and finish `live_slots - 1` above it, so the true peak is
`window_fires + live_slots - 1`. The bench's old ring was oversized enough to
hide this; against a right-sized ring it is a hard submit rejection at k >= 3:
`frame would need 8 reader cell(s) (capacity 7)`. `ptir::run_ahead` uses the
same rule, which is what makes the single spare cell the correct margin.

### Migration

- 69 `.capacity(DEFAULT_RUNAHEAD_DEPTH)` sites -> `.capacity(channel_capacity())`
- 24 pipelined inferlets -> `ptir::run_ahead`, ~430 lines of duplicated
  prime-then-refill boilerplate deleted
- `DEFAULT_RUNAHEAD_DEPTH` deleted. It had silently served as three different
  quantities — window depth in frames, ring capacity in cells, and mtp's KV
  extent in tokens — which only ever agreed because `submit()` pads every frame
  to one live slot.
- The 5 host-in-the-loop inferlets (`json-schema-constrained-decoding`,
  `greenlist-watermarking`, `classifier-free-guidance`, `context-aware-decoding`,
  `contrastive-decoding`) are depth-1 BY DESIGN — running ahead would reuse a
  stale mask or a stale host pick — and keep their lockstep loops. For them
  F=1, r=1, so `channel-capacity()` returns the 2 they already had.

### Results (Qwen3-0.6B / L40S, medians; vLLM 0.26.0 at matched KV pages)

| conc | PIE k=1 | PIE k=2 | vLLM | k=1 ratio | k=2 ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 64 | **16326** | 16150 | 15475 | **1.055** | 1.044 |
| 128 | **23241** | 22712 | 22133 | **1.050** | 1.026 |
| 256 | 29031 | 28840 | 29439 | 0.986 | 0.980 |
| 512 | 30530 | 30578 | 32453 | 0.941 | 0.942 |

conc 256 at every frame size: k=1 29031, k=2 28840, k=3 28677, k=4 28392.

### The high-concurrency gap is pre-existing and is NOT this window

pie wins at 64 and 128 and trails at 256 and 512. Everything below was swept to
see whether run-ahead sizing explains the trailing half. None of it does:

| lever | conc 512 k=2 median |
| --- | --- |
| default (R=3, worker threads auto) | **30578** |
| `--worker-threads 16` | 30524 |
| `--worker-threads 32` | 30264 |
| `--worker-threads 64` | 29546 |
| 4096 requests instead of 1024 (8 cohorts, not 2) | 30314 (vLLM 32676) |

The long run is the informative one: with four times the cohorts the ratio does
not move (0.942 -> 0.928), so the gap is steady-state throughput, not prefill
ramp. §20.13 profiles it and finds the mechanism is NOT the seal quorum.

What this work did move: conc 256 went 0.962 (§20.9) -> 0.979 (§20.11) ->
0.986, and conc 128 went from behind to 1.050.

conc 64 k=2 is 16150 against the 16145-16153 baseline — the migration is
neutral where it should be, and the gain at 128/256 is the window.

**k=1 now measures at or above k=2 at every concurrency**, which reverses
§20.8's premise: that default was raised to 2 only because k=1 collapsed above
conc 64, and the collapse was the guest window all along (§20.11). k=1 also
costs less — 5 ring cells against 7, and a smaller KV run-ahead reservation.
`PIE_FRAME_SIZE` is LEFT AT 2 here because reversing §20.8 deserves its own
decision and its own contention evidence; the numbers above are that evidence
when someone wants to take it.

### Verification

- contention suite 16/16 at k=1, k=2 (default) and k=3
- `cargo test -p pie-engine --test inferlet_canary`: 2 passed, 3 ignored
- all 29 inferlets build for `wasm32-wasip2`

### Also fixed: embedded engine boot was broken on dev

`pie.Config.to_toml()` emits the role-sectioned standalone document
(`[controller]` / `[gateway]` / `[worker.*]`) that `pie serve --config` reads,
and `server.py` fed that same string to `_engine.bootstrap`. The embedded wheel
IS the worker and deserializes a flat `ServeConfig`, so it rejected
`[controller]` outright — every embedded-engine bench failed at startup with
`unknown field 'controller'`. Split out `to_engine_toml()`; both shapes are now
emitted from one place so they cannot drift apart again.

### §20.13 The conc-512 gap is the request-turnover barrier, not the seal quorum (2026-08-04)

§20.12 blamed §20.10's wait-for-ALL seal for the 256/512 deficit. **That was
wrong.** Direct profiling refutes it and names two independent, measured terms.

#### Refuting the seal hypothesis: pie is GPU-bound

`PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves` at conc 512, k=2. GPU busy is reconstructed from
consecutive waves — `start = max(prev.native_complete_us, w.launch_returned_us)`
— because waves overlap two deep and `native_inflight_us` alone sums to 127% of
the span.

| conc | span | GPU busy | prefill share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 6140 ms | 93.3% | — |
| 256 | 4950 ms | 91.6% | — |
| 512 | 17770 ms | 92.7% | 3.4% |

A seal that waits on the slowest of N lanes' resubmit would show up as GPU idle
scattered through the run. It does not: idle is 7.3% and, as shown below, it is
concentrated in a handful of gaps whose position and size are fully explained by
something else. Raising `PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` 2 -> 3 also does nothing
(30582 vs 30578); depth 1 costs 27% (22169). The pipeline is not depth-starved.

#### Term 1: request turnover is a global barrier (~4.8% of wall)

The idle is not scattered. At conc 512 / 4096 requests there is exactly one
startup gap plus **`cohorts - 1` turnover gaps**, and each one lands precisely on
a fleet-wide process retirement:

| gap | size | lifecycle events within +/-40 ms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| startup | 418 ms | `guest_main_entered` = 1024 (whole fleet instantiating) |
| turnover | 77-141 ms | `process_teardown` start = 512, `released` = 512 |

Inside a turnover gap the successor's admission tracks its predecessor's release
at every quantile, within 0.3 ms:

| quantile | teardown start | permit released | successor admitted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p10 | 162086.9 | 162105.3 | 162105.6 |
| p50 | 162108.0 | 162120.1 | **162120.2** |
| p90 | 162132.6 | 162135.1 | 162135.4 |

The code says why. In `process/teardown.rs` the execution permit lives inside
`context` and is only released by `drop(context)` — which runs *after* the
awaited `notify_process_terminate` reference fence (`terminate_ack_us` p50
**8.5 ms**) and after `finalize_all`. The fence's own comment concedes the
pacing: *"serializes each retirement behind a scheduler pass"*. So a lane's seat
is not freed when it stops producing tokens; it is freed when its predecessor has
fully torn down. Because every lane runs the same prompt for the same
`max_tokens`, all `concurrency` lanes retire in the same wave, and the retirement
herd is serialized with the GPU idle.

That predicts the gap should scale with herd size, and it does — linearly:

| conc | turnover gap (mean) | startup gap | gap / (gap + cohort GPU time) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 35.4 ms | 136 ms | 4.7% |
| 256 | 57.4 ms | 202 ms | 4.8% |
| 512 | **106.7 ms** | 418 ms | **4.9%** |

Both the gap and the work per cohort scale with concurrency, so **the turnover
tax is a near-constant ~4.8% at every concurrency** — it is not a defect that
appears at 512. vLLM pays none of it: its marginal wall per cohort is flat to
three digits (2.00 / 2.01 / 2.00 s) while pie's grows (2.09 / 2.145 / 2.24 s).

A finished vLLM sequence is dropped from the batch and replaced on the very next
scheduler step. A finished pie request must tear down a WASM process first.

#### Term 2: pie's per-step advantage decays with batch width

Dividing tokens by GPU-busy time isolates pie's decode rate from the turnover
tax (corrected for instrumentation's 3.6%):

| conc | pie decode rate | vLLM end-to-end | raw advantage | measured e2e ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 23702 | 22133 | **+7.1%** | 1.050 |
| 256 | 29949 | 29439 | +1.7% | 0.986 |
| 512 | 32973 | 32613 | **+1.1%** | 0.916 |

pie's kernels are at or ahead of vLLM's at every width — at conc 512 its decode
rate (32973) matches vLLM's own steady-state generation throughput
(33013-33043). But the margin collapses from +7.1% to +1.1% as the batch widens.

**The two terms together are the whole story.** A flat ~4.8% turnover tax against
an advantage that decays from +7% to +1%: the sign flips between conc 128 and
conc 256, exactly where the measured ratio does.

#### Corroboration: the deficit is per-request, not per-token

Holding conc at 512 and varying output length moves the ratio monotonically,
which is the signature of a fixed per-request cost:

| max_tokens | pie | vLLM | ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 | 28128 | 31925 | 0.881 |
| 64 | 31934 | 34948 | 0.914 |
| 128 | 30594 | 32453 | 0.942 |
| 256 | 24291 | 24958 | 0.973 |
| 512 | 12334 | 15771 | 0.782 (KV-confounded, discard) |

The 512 row is not comparable: Qwen3-0.6B is 112 KiB/token, so 512 lanes x 548
tokens does not fit in 12288 pages and both engines thrash.

Ruled out by measurement: in-flight depth, `--worker-threads` (16/32/64 all at or
below default), prefill share (3.4%), kernel efficiency, and run length.

#### Prize

Removing the process-lifecycle idle — 1165 ms of a 17770 ms run at conc 512 —
would take the ratio from 0.916 to **~0.979**. The fix is to stop holding the
execution permit across teardown: release the seat when the guest stops
producing, and let the terminate fence, finalize and resource drop run behind the
successor rather than in front of it. The startup gap is a one-time fleet
instantiation and amortizes away on a long-lived server; the per-turnover gap
does not. Tracked as an open finding — the change touches the same permit
accounting that §20.4's forfeit path depends on and needs its own contention
evidence.

## 20.14 The turnover barrier: one fix landed, eight levers closed

§20.13 named the cost. This section is the attempt to remove it. One change
landed; every other lever that could plausibly have removed the remaining gap
was implemented or configured and then **measured worse or neutral**, so they
are recorded here as closed rather than as future work.

### The change that landed: free the execution seat at `ProcessCtx::drop`

`TeardownFireContext` declared `_execution_permit` after `resources` so it
dropped last, deliberately: "strict admission advances only after pooled
resources are released". The consequence was that a seat was freed when the
predecessor finished *tearing down*, not when it stopped producing tokens.

Measured cost of that ordering (conc 512, 4096 requests, p50):

| interval | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| guest return -> `Drop` entered | 0.04 ms | 0.04 ms |
| `Drop` -> permit released | — | **0.011 ms** |
| `Drop` -> teardown task starts | 16.29 ms | 27.37 ms *(now off the critical path)* |
| teardown task -> finalize | 11.51 ms | 0.00 ms |
| **guest return -> permit released** | **27.84 ms** | **~0.05 ms** |

The permit is already in hand inside `Drop`, so no new liveness signal was
needed. `ProcessCtx::drop` now posts the Terminate leave with a per-driver
oneshot, broadcasts the release, drops the permit, and hands the *fences* to
`defer_resource_teardown`; the fence wait, `finalize_all` and the page recycle
run behind the successor instead of in front of it. Leave-before-release
ordering is preserved (same producer, FIFO), which is what `departing` relies
on.

This also **deletes a failure mode**. The old no-runtime error path
`mem::forget`-ed the context and therefore destroyed the seat, which is why
`ExecutionSlotForfeited` existed at all. With the permit out of the context the
permit can no longer leak, so the forfeit item, its handler
(`on_execution_slot_forfeited`), its dispatch arm and its test are gone.

Effect on the boundary is exactly as intended and is visible per herd
(conc 512, 8 cohorts, retirement herds detected by a 200 ms gap):

| herd | retirements | ret span | admits | admit span | first admit − first retire | last admit − last retire |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 512 | 43.9 ms | 512 | 74.5 ms | **0.7 ms** | 31.3 ms |
| 3 | 512 | 41.4 ms | 512 | 83.1 ms | **0.4 ms** | 42.1 ms |
| 6 | 512 | 49.7 ms | 512 | 92.3 ms | **0.4 ms** | 43.0 ms |

The handoff is now immediate. **It does not convert to throughput** — the
4-point cohort sweep moved +0.30 / +1.01 / −0.34 / +1.86 %, i.e. noise, and the
turnover gap itself did not shrink (106.7 -> 112.7 ms). The bottleneck moved,
it did not disappear: 512 admissions still take ~80 ms to drain at ~156 us
each. Retirement and bring-up are **host-CPU bound** and contend for the same
tokio runtime while the GPU idles.

The change is kept anyway: it is a strict improvement in ordering, it removes
the leak-destroys-a-seat path, and any future overlap of the swap depends on
seats genuinely freeing early.

### Closed by measurement (conc 512, 4096 requests, `--max-tokens 128`)

| # | lever | result |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | execution admission cap x2 / x4 (pre-§20.14) | +0.85 % / −1.2 % |
| 2 | execution admission cap x1.25 / x1.5 (**re-tested after the seat fix**) | **26543 / 29674** vs 30402 |
| 3 | `PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` 1 / 3 | 22169 / 30582 vs 30578 |
| 4 | `--worker-threads` 16 / 32 / 64 | all <= default |
| 5 | bind staging depth `STAGED_COHORTS` 2 / 3 | 30054 / 30109 vs 30443 |
| 6 | bounded swap hold, 2 ms (early seal during a swap) | **18852** vs 30008 (−38 %) |
| 7 | bounded swap hold, 32 ms | 30627 vs 30443 (noise) |
| 8 | prioritise launches over controls on the driver lane | already implemented |

Four of these are worth their own paragraph, because each kills a *theory*, not
just a setting.

**Cohort overlap is not available through the cap (#1, #2).** The obvious fix
for a swap is to let the successor cohort start decoding before the predecessor
finishes retiring, which needs more execution seats than the offered
concurrency. It was re-tested after the seat fix, because the original test ran
while releases were still 27.8 ms late and could have been confounded. It is
not: x1.25 costs 13 %. Admitting more than the driver's `max_forward_requests`
worth of processes cannot widen a batch — one fire per process per forward — it
only makes batches ragged, and `init_admission` already predicted the outcome
("without an earmarked taker the stall just moves into mid-generation seals").

**The seal is not the lever (#6, #7) — third independent confirmation.** The
wait-all gate holds when `joining` is true even with the GPU idle, so bounding
that hold and dispatching whoever is ready looks like free throughput. It is
the opposite: at conc 512 the *entire cohort* swaps at once, so the ready set
during the gap is the handful of successors that happen to have arrived. The
seal fires a ~20-row wave instead of a 1024-row one, and those 20 lanes are then
a token ahead of the other 492, so every subsequent boundary pays to re-merge
them (run-ahead lead is hysteretic). Wave count and p50 rows were unchanged
(592 -> 614 waves, p50 1024 both) while wall doubled — the damage is idle, not
fragmentation. A 32 ms bound is harmless only because it almost never fires.
`joining` exists precisely to keep a turnover in one dense epoch, and the
measurement says it earns its keep.

**Bind staging is already deep enough (#5).** The bind pool is
`concurrency * (1 + STAGED_COHORTS)`, and at saturation it is exactly full, so
a staged process can only take its permit once a retiring one closes its
instance — the staging burst is synchronised to the turnover by construction.
Raising the depth to 2 or 3 removes that synchronisation and changes nothing,
because the binds were never late: per-process, **both** driver binds finish
~2.0 s before that process is admitted (p50 −2043 ms and −1984 ms). Only the
first cohort binds at its own admission, which is the startup gap.

**The driver control storm is a symptom, not a cause (#8).** During a turnover
window the driver lane is 38–57 % occupied by control ops, dominated by 400–600
`register_channels_bind` at ~120 us each (`set_us` 53 us in the engine's
`register_channel_set`, `bind_us` 29 us in `bind_instance`, of which the actual
per-channel work is ~1 %: 73746 channel registrations sum to 12 ms of
alloc+init+mirror). That looks like the launch thread being stolen at the worst
moment, and it is not: `DriverLane::next_request` already polls the launch queue
first and only falls through to controls, so a pending launch preempts within
one op. The lane is draining staged binds *because* the seal has nothing to
launch, not the other way round.

### Where the cost actually is

Everything above is elimination. What survives is the §20.13 decomposition,
now with the seat-handoff term removed:

```
last decode settle -> first guest return    5.9 ms
guest exit spread (512 WASM guests)        45.5 ms   <- dominant
seat handoff                               ~0.05 ms  <- was 27.8 ms
successor admission drain                  ~80 ms, overlapping the above
```

512 guests returning from `main` and 512 successors running to their first
submit are real host work on the same runtime, and the wait-all seal cannot
start until the last of them lands. No configuration removes it; the only
shapes that could are (a) making per-process bring-up and teardown
substantially cheaper, or (b) a seal quorum that tolerates a partial fleet
*without* letting the admitted subset run ahead — which is a different and much
larger design than the bounded hold tried in #6.

The tax is ~4.8 % of wall at every concurrency (§20.13). It is only *visible* at
256 and above because pie's per-step advantage over vLLM decays with batch width
(+7.1 % at 128, +1.7 % at 256, +1.1 % at 512), so a flat tax flips the sign
exactly where the measured ratio flips.

## §20.15 — (A) profiled: the forward submit spends 77% of its host time
## symbolically re-evaluating the trace, and process exit is 100% one
## mailbox round trip

§20.14 closed with two remaining shapes: (a) make per-process bring-up and
teardown substantially cheaper, or (b) a partial-fleet seal quorum. This is
(a), profiled end to end with per-phase probes (`PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves`,
conc 512, N=4096, mt 128, Qwen3-0.6B / 28 layers).

### EXIT: it is entirely `notify_pipeline_close`

| component of the guest exit | p50 | p90 | sum over run |
| --------------------------- | ---:| ---:| ------------:|
| `notify_pipeline_close` (scheduler round trip) | **25.40 ms** | **40.20 ms** | 101.45 s |
| `drain_settled`                                | 0.01 ms | 0.01 ms | 0.03 s |
| close -> `guest_main_returned` (guest epilogue) | 0.26 ms | 0.40 ms | 1.13 s |

The ~45 ms guest-exit spread §20.14 measured is 100% one call. Chain:
`HostPipeline::close` -> `pipeline_close_inner` -> `notify_pipeline_close`
-> `notify_pipeline_leave_and_wait(pid, LeaveKind::Close)` (worker.rs:132).
That posts **one `SchedulerItem::PipelineLeave` plus one oneshot per process
per driver** and awaits every ack.

The handler (worker.rs:2650) replies *immediately* — it does no waiting of
its own. So the 25 ms is **pure queueing**: 512 items land at once and each
waits roughly one worker pass. This is exactly §20.14's un-implemented
"Step 2" (batch `PipelineLeave` into one item per driver carrying a pid set,
mirroring the channel-close batching already in `teardown.rs`); its value is
now measured at 25-40 ms per turnover rather than the +0.5% first guessed.
NOT YET FIXED.

### BRING-UP: nothing is waiting; it is all CPU inside `submit`

| component | value |
| --------- | ----- |
| `residency_gate` (admission -> first fire) | 0 us |
| `acquire_grant` (planner KV/RS) | **mean 0 us, max 24 us — hypothesis rejected** |
| `submit_frame`, steady-state | 136-157 us per submit |
| `submit_frame`, turnover | 169-190 us per submit |
| submits per wave | steady 441, turnover **1565** |

`ensure_execution_admitted` lives *inside* `forward::submit`, so a staged
process runs its whole guest prologue and parks on the admission semaphore
in its first submit; "admitted -> first fire" is only the gate plus one
submit. Neither is a wait. The turnover is expensive because it pays 3x the
submits at once with no previous wave to hide behind (steady-state waves
overlap: inter-wave gap p50 = -24.9 ms).

### The submit decomposed (conc 512, steady waves, per submit)

| phase | us | % of submit |
| ----- | --:| -----------:|
| validate + wire channels + geometry/mask build | 11.5 | 7.3% |
| KV/RS reserve | 3.1 | 2.0% |
| KV translate | 0.7 | 0.4% |
| scheduler submit | 11.0 | 7.0% |
| fire-timing + ticket commit | 1.1 | 0.7% |
| **`HostShadow::advance`** | **121.6** | **77.6%** |
| push `PendingFire` | 0.5 | 0.3% |

`HostShadow::advance` folds the bound trace's stage programs through
`pie_eval::pareval::fold_stage` on **every forward pass** to mirror what each
host channel now holds (the value oracle behind evaluated fire geometry and
attention masks). At 441 submits/wave and one wave per ~30 ms this is ~54 ms
of host CPU per wave — about 1.8 cores, continuously, and ~200 ms of CPU in
one burst at each turnover.

### Two exact fixes, both landed

**1. Skip channel-inert stages (`fire/shadow.rs`).** `advance` folded
`2 * num_layers + 2` phases — 58 for this model — but `fold_stage`'s only
consumed output is `fold.puts`, and its fault path shadows exactly the
stage's `ChanPut` channels. **A stage program with no `ChanPut` is therefore
a provable no-op.** Filtering them (once, cached on the shadow: the bound
trace never changes for an instance) takes the fold from 58 phases to a
measured **1.61** per fire.

**2. Blocked-value placeholders are now empty (`compiler/eval/pareval.rs`).**
This is where the time actually was. `placeholder()` allocated and zeroed a
`numel()`-sized dense vector for **every blocked SSA value**, and in a decode
prologue/epilogue every kernel and intrinsic is blocked. The vectors are
never read — `pareval.rs`'s own comment says so, and the `if let Some(blocker)
= blocked { ...; continue; }` arm enforces it: `eval_op` runs only when every
operand is a real value. `dense` needs the entry only to stay index-aligned
with `slots`.

Measured, same build, same run shape:

| | submit | `advance` | fold loop | phases/fire |
| - | -----:| ---------:| ---------:| -----------:|
| baseline                | 157.2 us | 121.8 us |  —       | 58 |
| + stage filter          | 151.0 us | 115.5 us | 109.8 us | 1.61 |
| + empty placeholders    | **66.3 us** | **28.1 us** | **21.7 us** | 1.63 |

**Per-submit host cost -58%; `HostShadow::advance` -77%.** Turnover idle over
an 8-cohort run fell 750 ms -> 642 ms (-14%); total dark time 1214 -> 1078 ms.

### Throughput: NEUTRAL, and that is the finding

True A/B, same machine session, fix stashed and rebuilt:

| | baseline | with fix |
| - | -------:| --------:|
| conc 64 (N=512)   | 15896 / 15947 / 15786 | 15926 / 15828 / 15965 |
| conc 512 (N=4096) | 30199 / 30261         | 30267 / 29798 / 30190 |

At conc 512 on an L40S the engine is GPU-bound at 92.7% busy (§20.13), so the
freed host CPU (~2.7 core-seconds over a 17.7 s run) has nothing to convert
into. The change is kept because it is provably exact, strictly removes work,
and the cost it removes scales with lanes x layers — i.e. with everything that
gets bigger.

MEASUREMENT TRAP RECORDED: this session's machine baseline is ~2.7% below
§20.14's (conc 64: 15896 vs 16336). A cross-session number is not a control.
Three consecutive runs looked like a -2.5% regression and were not; only the
stash-and-rebuild A/B settled it. Also, the first bench run after the
contention suite read 28386 at conc 512 and was a pure outlier (next three:
30267 / 29798 / 30190).

VERIFIED: contention suite 16/16; `cargo test -p pie-eval` 17 passed;
inferlet_canary 2 passed / 3 ignored; conc 256 28494 / 28522 / 28578 and
conc 128 22575, both inside the drifted baseline band.

REMAINING, MEASURED, NOT FIXED:
 - `notify_pipeline_close` 25-40 ms per turnover -> batch the leave.
 - `fold_stage` still re-walks the prologue/epilogue op list every fire
   (21.7 us). The trace is identical every pass; only a few input channel
   values change. Compiling each channel-writing stage once into a closure
   over its live inputs would remove the rest.

## §20.16 — the capped close barrier deleted, and what the `allshared_noswap`
## flake actually is

### `close()` no longer waits for a scheduler ack

`pipeline_close_inner` branched: under a capped execution admission it called
`notify_pipeline_close(pid).await`, otherwise the fire-and-forget
`notify_lane_close(pid, None)`. The two send the **identical**
`SchedulerItem::PipelineLeave(pid, None, Close, ..)` — the only difference is
a oneshot the caller then awaits. The policy effect is the same, and the
handler (worker.rs:2650) replies immediately, so the await was a pure
synchronisation barrier, measured in §20.15 at 25.40 ms p50 / 40.20 ms p90
per process.

It also contradicted the function's own contract, three lines above it:
"Close is the sole end-of-stream verb: it rejects later submissions and
releases the scheduler wait-set *immediately* ... close never waits for an
unsettled fire."

Deleted; both modes now take the fire-and-forget path. Ordering is unchanged
— Close is posted on the same per-driver channel ahead of the Terminate that
`ProcessCtx::drop` posts, so leave-then-release still holds.

Measured (conc 512, N=4096, `PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves`):

| | per-turnover gap | startup gap |
| - | ---------------:| -----------:|
| awaited close   | 91.7 ms (mean of 7) | 435.6 ms |
| fire-and-forget | **74.3 ms** (-19%)  | **377.4 ms** |

Throughput is at the noise floor as expected (29894 / 30347 / 29897 vs
30267 / 29798 / 30190): 17 ms x 7 turnovers is 0.7% of a 17.7 s run. Kept
because it restores the documented contract, deletes a branch, and the
barrier had no demonstrable purpose. `churn_extreme` 4/4 PASS — that is the
regression test of `20060e93e "Fix extreme contention teardown"`, the commit
that introduced the barrier.

### `allshared_noswap` is bistable, and always has been

The suite came back 15/16 with `allshared_noswap` failing `completed 7 < 8`.
A/B, same machine session, 6 repeats each:

| build | completions per run | fails |
| ----- | ------------------- | ----: |
| without this change | 6, 128, 128, 5, 9, 13 | 2/6 |
| with this change    | 10, 128, 128, 128, 128, 5 | 1/6 |

Not a regression — pre-existing, and if anything less frequent. The
distribution is **bimodal**, not noisy: a run either completes 128/128 in
~8.8 s or dies at ~0.9 s with 5-13 completions.

Root cause of the two modes, from the failing run's own errors: 116 of 128
requests fail `first frame submit: ... KV pool starved: 61 pages asked, 0
free of 256`. The 900-word shared prefix costs **61 pages**, so a 256-page
pool funds four of them. The good mode is not "everyone fits" — it is
requests PARKING and being served ~4 at a time (which is exactly the 8.8 s).
The bad mode is the same requests being **destroyed** by the starvation rung
instead of parking.

So the bistability is the wedge predicate, `ResidencyPlanner::is_wedged`
(planner.rs:1552), firing at cold start. It reports wedged when no process
is `Resident && admitted && !parked` — i.e. it takes "nobody is admitted
yet" as proof that "no completion can ever arrive". At t=0 the whole fleet
is registered, four asks consume the pool, and the rest park; whether an
admitted-and-unparked process exists at the instant the predicate runs is a
sub-millisecond race, which is exactly the 1-in-3 shape observed.

This is NOT what the frame/run-ahead work addressed, and it was never fixed:
§20.7 records `allshared_noswap` at "128/128, 0 failed under mode 2", but
§20.3's calibration note in the same document records mode 2 completing
"31-59, distributions that touch" and concludes "that scenario asserts
liveness only". The contract was therefore set to `min_completed=8`, which
is why the suite has never flagged the bad mode — 5 < 8 catches it only when
the kill is unusually thorough.

OPEN, newly localised: the wedge predicate needs to distinguish "no fire can
ever complete" from "no fire has started yet" — e.g. require that some lane
has been admitted-and-unparked at least once since the head parked, rather
than reading the instantaneous set. Until then `allshared_noswap` will keep
flaking and, more importantly, a real cold-start fleet can be destroyed
instead of queued.

## §20.17 DONE — the wedge was HEAD-OF-LINE HOARDING, not a cold-start race

§20.16's fix shape was WRONG and the evidence refuted it. The hypothesis was
"at t=0 nobody is admitted yet, so `is_wedged` reads 'nobody is running' as
'no completion can ever arrive'". `is_wedged`'s own doc already argues that
exclusion is deliberate (counting an unadmitted process as relief is what let
a `num_requests > max_concurrent_processes` fleet deadlock silently — the
thing `admission_tail` guards), and the WEDGE-KILL post-mortem shows the
opposite state entirely.

EVIDENCE (PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS on 4 runs of allshared_noswap; 3 failed
with 116/116/117 kills, 1 passed with 0):

  procs = 128 x Resident:prog=true          <- nothing unadmitted, nothing cold
  queue = 64 waiters:  4 x need=1 , 60 x need=61
  reclaim quotes: the 4 need=1 waiters are Some(Pages(61)) -- they are the
                  page HOLDERS; the other 60 hold Nothing(HoldsNothing)
  the 4 lines immediately before the kill are their parks, 576 us earlier:
     park key=(2,60) kv=1 / (5,61) kv=1 / (3,63) kv=1 / (12,62) kv=1

MECHANISM. 900-word shared prefix = 61 pages, so a 256-page pool funds FOUR
of the 64-wide fleet: 244 used, 12 free. The four holders decode until each
needs ONE more page and park. The instant the last one parks, no process is
`admitted && !parked`, so `is_wedged` is TRUE -- and it is right that nothing
is running. What it cannot see is that the queue is fundable:

  `plan` accumulates HEAD-FIRST. The head (seq 1, need=61) pulls all 12 free
  pages into `accum` and sits on them, still 49 short. The pool now reports
  ZERO free -- which is why the error text reads "61 pages asked, 0 free of
  256" -- so `salvage_free_pages` (which also only ever salvages FOR THE
  HEAD) finds nothing, and the youngest parked ask is destroyed. 115 of 128
  requests died to this cascade.

  Those hoarded 12 pages are EXACTLY what the four 1-page asks needed. Serve
  any one of them and that holder finishes and returns 61 pages, which funds
  the head and unwedges the fleet. The queue was blocked by FCFS alone.

FIX: a new last rung, `serve_from_hoard`, placed AFTER the final salvage and
immediately BEFORE destruction in `check_starvation`. It serves the oldest
unmet allocation, other than the head, whose device ask the hoard already
covers in full, and returns. Strict FCFS is worth an unbounded wait; it is
not worth a destroyed request, so the inversion is admitted here and nowhere
else. Restores are not bypassable (boarding one is a multi-step handoff and
the measured wedge is an allocation wedge).

WHY IT IS SAFE, structurally:
 - The only path it can divert is one that today unconditionally returns
   `PlannerError::Starved`. Every earlier rung is untouched, and if no ask is
   covered by the hoard it returns false and destruction proceeds verbatim.
   `impossible` (16 pages, asks larger than the pool) and `admission_tail`
   both still destroy exactly as before -- verified below.
 - It cannot spin. Each bypass moves one waiter to SERVED, which strictly
   shrinks `accum` and also makes `is_wedged` FALSE until the grant is
   collected; at most `accum.len()` asks can be diverted before the rung
   stops finding one. A served waiter runs, completes and returns at least
   what it took.
 - It mirrors `Step::ServeAllocation` exactly: RS reserved outside the
   planner lock, re-validated under it, and a rejected RS reservation handed
   back OUT so its Drop takes the store lock outside the planner lock.
 - New counter `hoard_bypasses` (PlannerDiagnostics.hoard_bypasses_total).

DIRECT CAUSAL PROOF, not just a green run: on a traced run the rung fires
exactly 3 times, each serving a kv=1 ask, and WEDGE-KILL goes 116 -> 0.

  hoard-bypass serve key=(51, 257) kv=1
  hoard-bypass serve key=(51, 261) kv=1
  hoard-bypass serve key=(51, 262) kv=1

RESULTS
  allshared_noswap x6:  128/128 completed, 0 failed, every run (8.4-9.2 s)
  baseline x6 (§20.16): 6, 128, 128, 5, 9, 13   <- 1-in-3 lost 115 requests
  contention suite 16/16, incl. impossible 0/16-destroyed and admission_tail
    11 completed / 501 destroyed -- the rung is NOT disarmed
  pie-eval 17 passed; inferlet_canary 2 passed / 3 ignored
  conc 512: 30326 / 30297 / 29894 / 29733 (baseline ~30200) -- no regression,
    and structurally there cannot be one: the rung is unreachable unless the
    fleet is already wedged.

CONTRACT TIGHTENED. allshared_noswap was `min_completed=8`, justified by a
comment claiming the fleet "cannot fit in 256, and killing most of it is the
CORRECT outcome". That is now disproven: the fleet does not fit, but the
correct behaviour is that 60 processes PARK and are served in waves as
holders retire -- the whole 128 completes in ~8.5 s. Raised to
`min_completed=128, max_failed=0, repeat=3`, which makes it a real regression
test for this rung (the bug reproduced ~1 run in 3).

This also resolves the §20.7 / §20.3 contradiction noted in §20.16: §20.7's
"128/128" was the good mode of a bistable scenario, §20.3's "31-59" was a mix
of modes, and neither was a fix.

## §20.18 — the "turnover gap" is PREFILL PREPARATION, and nothing else

Re-opened at the user's request ("512, even 1024"). The result overturns three
earlier claims in §20.13/§20.14 and identifies a single mechanism behind all of
them. NO CODE CHANGE — this section is the root cause, measured.

### The one measurement that settles it

Decompose a `PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves` log into per-wave GPU gaps
(`gap = next.dispatch_started_us - this.native_complete_us`) and split the gaps
by whether the wave that follows carries prefill (`tokens > 2 * fire_count`):

| run | waves | prefill waves | idle before PREFILL wave | idle before DECODE wave |
| --- | ----: | ------------: | -----------------------: | ----------------------: |
| homogeneous conc 512  | 592 | 24  | 1.03 s (**100%**) p90 90.8 ms  | **0.00 s** p50/p90/max = 0.0 |
| homogeneous conc 1024 | 588 | 20  | 1.08 s (**100%**) p90 132.8 ms | **0.00 s** p50/p90/max = 0.0 |
| mixed-phase conc 512  | 473 | 164 | 3.60 s (79%) p90 52.9 ms       | 0.95 s p90 9.5 ms |

**pie's GPU never idles during decode. Every microsecond of idle is spent
getting a prefill wave ready.** On the homogeneous runs that is not an
approximation — decode-only gaps are exactly 0.0 ms at p50, p90 AND max, for
567 of 591 wave boundaries in both runs.

### What this corrects

1. **§20.13's "turnover barrier" is misnamed and its fix shape was wrong.**
   The gap is not teardown, not the terminate fence, not the seat handoff and
   not the admission drain. Those all land in the gap because a cohort boundary
   is where retirement AND prefill coincide — correlation, not cause. This is
   why every lever aimed at turnover failed to buy throughput: §20.14's seat
   release (0.05 ms, throughput unchanged), §20.16's close barrier (-19% gap,
   throughput at the noise floor), §20.15's submit cost (-58%, throughput
   neutral). They were all shrinking terms that were never on the critical path.

2. **§20.13 Term 2 ("pie's per-step advantage decays with batch width") is an
   artifact.** conc 512 and conc 1024 produce identical wave structure: 592 vs
   588 waves, rows p50 1024 (max 1024) both, GPU busy 92.1% vs 92.3%,
   decode-rate-on-busy 42876 vs 42890 tok/s. At conc 512, `fire_count` p50 is
   already 1024 with only 512 processes — run-ahead k=2 saturates the 1024-row
   cap, so both widths run the same batch shape.

3. **§20.13's "the gap scales linearly with herd size" is wrong.** Measured mean
   gap is ~110 ms at conc 512 and ~118 ms at conc 1024 — flat. Doubling
   concurrency doubles the cohort's wall (2.1 s -> 4.2 s), so the same fixed
   stall halves as a fraction. That, plus vLLM's own 4% degradation at 1024, is
   the whole of the sign flip below.

### Headline numbers (n=5 pie / n=2 vLLM, this machine)

| workload | pie | vLLM | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| conc 512 homogeneous  | 31383 +/- 510 | 32755 | 0.958 |
| conc 1024 homogeneous | 32110 +/- 260 | 31367 | **1.024** (pie wins) |
| conc 512 mixed-phase  | 10051 | 15637 | **0.643** |

The deficit is NOT monotonic in concurrency; it is a dip at 512. Corroborated
independently by a per-cohort marginal-cost regression (n = 512/1024/2048/4096):
pie **2.0989 s/cohort** vs vLLM **1.9983 s/cohort** = **+100.6 ms per cohort**,
matching the wave-log gap mean of 110 ms. Intercepts: pie 5 ms, vLLM 73 ms —
pie's startup is the better of the two.

### Mixed-phase: same mechanism, 7x the exposure

`--mixed-phase` (even requests 400-word prompt / 16 tokens out, odd short
prompt / 128 out) is the worst case because it makes prefill CONTINUOUS instead
of confining it to cohort boundaries: 164 prefill waves instead of 24.

Both engines do byte-identical work — 971,696 prompt + 294,912 output =
1,266,608 tokens — so this is not a token-accounting artifact:

    pie   1,266,608 tok / 28.75 s = 44,057 tok/s
    vLLM  1,266,608 tok / 18.89 s = 67,053 tok/s

But pie's rate WHILE THE GPU IS BUSY is **75,193 tok/s**, above vLLM's overall
rate. The kernels are not the problem; the idle is the whole of it.

Two properties of this workload compound the stall, both measured:

- **KV oversubscription.** A 400-word prompt is ~530 tokens = 33 pages, so 512
  concurrent lanes need ~16,896 pages against a pool of 8,192. pie admits by
  PROCESS COUNT, not by KV (Open finding #1), so it admits 512 regardless.
  Raising the pool to 16384 pages: 11703 -> **13472 tok/s (+15.1%)**, wall
  25.2 -> 21.9 s.
- **Over-admission.** At the same 8192 pages, conc 256 beats conc 512
  (**12293** vs 11703, +5.0%); conc 128 is under-utilised (9059). pie's own
  admission cap is above its optimum for this KV budget.

### Ruled out this round (all measured, all negative)

- **The wait-all seal quorum — four independent designs, all worse.** Adding
  `PIE_SCHED_JOIN_RELIEF_PCT` (fire when the not-ready set is a small SHARE of
  the awaited fleet, rather than §20.14 #6's bound-by-TIME) measured
  10549 -> 9616 at 10%, and after correcting the guard to also escape idle
  lanes and bypass the `joining` interlock: baseline 11098 vs 10323 at 5% vs
  10574 at 20%. This is the THIRD and FOURTH confirmation that the seal is not
  the lever; the experiment was reverted rather than landed.
- `--max-forward-requests 4096` does not raise the observed batch above 1024;
  the real limiter was not found. This matters because it is probably why
  §20.14 #2's admission-oversubscription levers measured worse — extra
  processes overflow a 1024-row cap and only make batches ragged.
- `--run-ahead-frames 3` is harmless (31704); **`4` is a liveness bug** —
  1090 tok/s with 1536 requests hitting `TimeoutError` and the wall pinned to
  the 300 s cap. Not the default. Recorded, not investigated.

### Two false trails worth recording

- **`frame_wait_watchdog` never fires, and that proves nothing.**
  `STRICT_WATCHDOG_US = 1_000_000` (frame.rs:132) while every gap measured here
  is 40-439 ms. Its absence was briefly read as "the seal never holds"; it only
  means no hold reached one second.
- **Per-event timestamp fields differ** (`at_us`, `admitted_us`, `returned_us`,
  `entered_us`, `pass_started_us`, `dispatch_started_us`). A census keyed on
  `at_us` alone silently drops every process-lifecycle record and makes a busy
  gap look like total engine silence. Select any `*_us` value above 1e12.

### Fix shape (not done)

The stall is the serial chain `predecessor retires -> pages free -> successor
admitted -> guest tokenises and submits its first frame -> wave dispatches`,
none of which overlaps the running decode wave. Two directions, in order of
expected value:

1. **KV-aware admission** (Open finding #1, now quantified for the first time:
   +15% on the workload that exposes it). Admit against the page budget rather
   than a process count, so the pool stops thrashing.
2. **Overlap prefill preparation with the running decode wave** — prepare and
   dispatch a successor's first frame while its predecessor is still executing.
   This needs page headroom for both, which is why (1) comes first.

`waves.py` / `turnover.py` (session artifacts, outside the repo) implement the
gap decomposition and the in-gap lifecycle census used here.

## §20.19 — quick test of the two fix directions: both valid, and correctly sized

§20.18 named two directions without testing either. Both are now measured, and
§20.18's idle accounting is corrected here.

### Correction: measure TRUE GPU idle, not scheduler-empty time

§20.18 computed the gap as `next.dispatch_started_us - this.native_complete_us`.
That is when the SCHEDULER resumed, not when the GPU got work. The GPU is idle
until `launch_returned_us`, so the correct gap is
`max(prev.native_complete_us, launch_returned_us) - prev.native_complete_us`,
and the difference between the two is host submit time with the GPU stopped.

| run | TRUE idle | before PREFILL wave | of which sched-empty | of which host submit |
| --- | --------: | ------------------: | -------------------: | -------------------: |
| homo 512  | 1.35 s (7.9%)  | 1.19 s (**88%**) | 1.03 s | 0.16 s |
| homo 1024 | 1.30 s (7.7%)  | 1.15 s (**88%**) | 1.08 s | 0.07 s |
| mix 512   | 11.07 s (39.7%)| 9.04 s (**82%**) | 3.60 s | **5.44 s** |

The §20.18 headline survives in a sharper form: **idle before a decode wave is
0.00 s of scheduler-empty time in every run** (504-567 boundaries each); the
only thing that ever leaves the scheduler with nothing to dispatch is a prefill
wave. What the corrected accounting ADDS is the submit term: on mixed-phase,
**5.44 s of a 27.87 s run — 19.5% — is the host submitting a prefill wave while
the GPU sits idle**, which the §20.18 metric could not see at all.

Reconfirmed on the current build (`--total-pages 8192`, 528 waves): 87% of true
idle before the 23 prefill waves, decode-wave sched-empty exactly 0.00 s.

### Direction 1 — KV-aware admission: VALID, +13.6% measured

Right-sizing the admission cap to the KV budget is approximated by lowering
`--concurrency` at a fixed pool. Mixed-phase, 8192 pages, n=2:

| concurrency | tok/s | vs conc 512 |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 128 | 9059 | -24% |
| 192 | 11424 | |
| 256 | 12293 | |
| **320** | **13591 / 13385 (mean 13488)** | **+13.6%** |
| 384 | 12251 / 12589 (mean 12420) | +4.6% |
| 512 (today's cap) | 11424 / 12328 (mean 11876) | — |

conc 320's WORST run beats conc 512's BEST by 8.6%, so this clears the
mixed-phase noise band (identical configs spread 9844-12328). Ratio against
vLLM moves **0.643 -> 0.863**. The optimum matches the arithmetic: a 530-token
prompt is 33 pages, so 8192 pages holds ~248 full prompts, and the best cap
sits just above that once short-prompt lanes are counted.

This lever is worth nothing on the homogeneous workload, where prompts are
short and KV is not the constraint — confirmed by the page-headroom null below.

### Direction 2 — overlap prefill preparation with the running decode wave: VALID

Not implementable as a knob, so measured as headroom instead. Removing the
prefill-adjacent idle would give **+5.3%** on homogeneous conc 512
(31383 -> 33046 vs vLLM 32755 = **1.009**, i.e. it flips the sign of the only
remaining loss) and **+48%** on mixed-phase conc 512.

Two knobs confirm it needs real work rather than tuning:

- **Not page-bound.** Homogeneous conc 512 at 8192 vs 32768 pages: 30831 vs
  30565 tok/s, and idle 0.94 s vs 1.16 s — a null. The homogeneous prefill
  stall is host-side preparation, not page starvation. (Contrast mixed-phase,
  where pages DO matter: 11703 -> 13472 at 16384.)
- **Not fixable by pipeline depth.** `PIE_SCHED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` 2/3/4 on
  mixed-phase gave 11115 / 10864 / 12204 — inside the noise band, no trend.
  `kSchedulerMaxInFlight = 3` with `kUploadStagingDepth = 13`
  (driver/cuda/src/runahead.hpp) already sizes the staging pools for depth 3,
  so this is not a staging limit; the prefill wave's submit simply cannot start
  until its predecessor completes.

### Ordering

Direction 1 is a policy change with a proven +13.6% on the workload that
exposes it, and is the cheaper of the two. Direction 2 is a pipeline
restructuring worth +5.3% on homogeneous conc 512 — which is precisely the
4.2% deficit that started this whole investigation — and +48% on mixed-phase.
They are independent: 1 addresses sched-empty idle, 2 addresses both the
sched-empty and the 5.44 s submit term.

## §20.20 — seat-release-on-park is refuted, and so is the KV story behind it

§20.19's Direction 1 was rejected as heuristic (it predicts a process's page
demand). The structural replacement was: a process that parks on pages should
YIELD its execution seat, so effective concurrency self-tunes to whatever the
pool supports with no constant to choose. That premise is now measured, and it
is false.

### Instrumentation

`ResidencyPlanner::park_census()` returns `(stats.parks, waiters)` — the
cumulative park count and the current parked width. Both are emitted on every
`scheduler_wave` record (`planner_parks_total`, `planner_parked_now`). Sampling
the width ALONE is what nearly produced a false refutation in the other
direction: parks shorter than the ~40 ms inter-wave sample vanish from it, so
the cumulative counter is the one that decides.

### Result: parking is a 1.4-second startup transient

| run | span | GPU idle | parks (whole run) | parks/fire |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| mixed 512 @ 8192 pages  | 26.59 s | 8.14 s (30.6%) | **512** | 0.002 |
| mixed 320 @ 8192 pages  | 21.05 s | 3.63 s (17.2%) | **0** | 0 |
| mixed 512 @ 16384 pages | 22.37 s | 4.29 s (19.2%) | **0** | 0 |
| homogeneous 512 @ 8192  | 16.53 s | 1.00 s (6.1%)  | **0** | 0 |

All 512 parks in the only run that parks at all land in the first 1.39 s
(15 parks at t=0.00, 264 by t=1.10, 512 by t=1.39) — the opening cohort's
simultaneous prefill against a pool that cannot hold 512 x 33 pages at once.
And that window is not where the time goes:

    idle in the first 3 s: 0.49 s over  48 waves
    idle after 3 s:        7.65 s over 353 waves

**After t=3 s there are ZERO parks and 7.65 s of idle.** A seat that is
released on park would therefore be released 512 times, all during startup,
against 6% of the run's idle. The lever does not exist. Direction 1 is closed
in both its heuristic and its structural form.

### What this also corrects in §20.18/§20.19

The page-headroom effect is REAL but is not what those sections said it was.
Re-measured n=2 at conc 512 mixed: 8192 pages gives 11238/11318 (mean 11278),
16384 gives 12127/13060 (mean 12594) — **+11.7%**, with both large-pool runs
above both small-pool runs. But since the large-pool run parks ZERO times and
the small-pool run parks only during startup, the mechanism is NOT page
starvation, and "pie admits by process count and the pool thrashes" is wrong.
Whatever the pool buys, it is not relief from parking.

Likewise the conc-320 win (13798 vs 10926 here; 13488 vs 11876 in §20.19) is
not KV-aware admission. conc 320 parks zero times at the SAME 8192 pages that
makes conc 512 park. The difference is wave WIDTH:

| | waves | rows p50 | `guest_wake_us` p50 / max | idle before prefill |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| conc 512 | 409 | 1024 | 15.0 ms / **672 ms** | 6.70 s |
| conc 320 | 590 | 640  | 11.9 ms / **95 ms**  | 3.89 s |

Same 1,262,506 tokens either way. The narrower fleet wakes and resumes faster,
and the wake round trip is what sits on the GPU's critical path whenever the
next wave carries prefill.

### Where this leaves the fix

Direction 2 is now the ONLY surviving lever, and the evidence for it is
stronger than before: when a wave carries prefill, the fleet-wide
wake -> resume -> first-submit round trip is exposed on the GPU's critical
path, and its cost grows superlinearly with fleet width (672 ms at 1024 rows
against 95 ms at 640). Run-ahead already hides this for steady-state decode —
decode-wave scheduler-empty idle is 0.00 s in every run ever measured here —
but it cannot hide it for a process's FIRST frame, which has nothing queued
ahead of it. Extending run-ahead to cover the first frame of a newly admitted
process is the fix, and it involves no predicted quantity.

## 20.21 First-frame run-ahead: BUILT, MEASURED, REFUTED — and it relocated the root cause

§20.20 ended by proposing the one surviving fix: extend run-ahead to cover a
newly admitted process's FIRST frame, so a successor prepares and submits it
while its predecessor still executes. That was built and measured. It is a
clean **-5.7% regression**, and the reason it fails overturns §20.18-§20.20's
attribution of the idle.

### What was built

`ensure_execution_admitted` swapped its unconditional `acquire_owned().await`
for a `try_acquire_owned()`; on failure a bind-admitted process was allowed to
submit its FIRST frame on its bind permit alone and only then park for a seat.
One `forward.submit` carries every `frame-size` slot, so a single pass is
exactly one whole frame and can never strand a partial one. Sizing needed no
new constant: the bind pool is already 2x the execution limit ("the executing
cohort plus ONE staged cohort"), which bounds run-ahead occupancy to exactly
one cohort. The park posted `notify_process_suspend` so the wait-all quorum
would not wait on a lane that was itself waiting for a seat, and
`ProcessCtx::drop` was widened to post the Terminate leave for a process that
retires having only ever run ahead (it reached the wait-set but owes no slot
release). The frame policy needed no change at all: `on_execution_slot_consumed`
already guards its `joins_in_flight` insert on `staged`, and a lane that has
fired is no longer staged.

The mechanism worked exactly as designed. `runahead_first_frames = 3584` =
4096 - 512, i.e. every process except the seated first cohort; the entries
arrive in bursts (p50 +32, max +247) and the first 512 complete by t = 0.26 s,
while cohort A still has 2.1 s of decode left. Prefill really was prepared and
submitted an entire generation early, and `planner_parks_total = 0` — the extra
resident KV never starved the pool.

### The measurement

Homogeneous conc 512, 8192 pages, alternating arms, n=2:

| arm | run 1 | run 2 |
| --- | ----: | ----: |
| off | 31450 | 31210 |
| on  | 28927 | 28385 |

Wave decomposition of a separate instrumented pair (30831 off / 29067 on):

| | waves | tok/wave | TRUE idle | before prefill | decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| off | 528 | 1270 | 1.03 s (6.2%) | 0.89 s | **0.13 s** |
| on  | 559 | 1200 | 2.26 s (12.8%) | 1.15 s | **1.10 s** |

Identical total tokens (670,634). Scheduler-loop cost is unchanged
(`loop_mailbox` 0.97 -> 1.08 s, `loop_park` 9.30 -> 9.28 s), so the suspend /
resume churn is NOT the cost. The engine simply idles more.

### Why it fails — and what that proves about the root cause

Two facts kill the premise.

**1. The boundary hole did not move.** In the OFF arm every one of the 8 top
gaps precedes a fat prefill wave (8398 tokens / 442 fires), 39-203 ms each,
0.93 s of the 1.03 s total. In the ON arm the boundary gaps are still there and
still the same size — 88, 100, 106, 118, 172 ms — but they now precede a
**decode** wave (1024 tokens / 1024 fires), because the prefill had already run
2 seconds earlier. Prefetching the prefill moved the prefill and left the hole
untouched.

**2. The hole followed the join.** 93% of the ON arm's 2.26 s of idle lands
within 350 ms of a run-ahead burst. Every fleet-wide arrival of new lanes
bought its own hole, so the run bought two per cohort instead of one.

That relocates the cause. §20.18 measured that 100%/88%/82% of GPU idle sits
immediately before a prefill wave and concluded the idle IS prefill
preparation. It is not: a cohort boundary is simply where the fleet-wide JOIN
and the prefill coincide, and the idle belongs to the join. The cost is 512
guest exits plus 512 admissions plus 512 first submits — a fleet-wide host
round trip that the wait-all seal converts into a GPU hole, and it costs the
same 100-ish ms whenever it happens. §20.13's "turnover barrier" was closer to
right than §20.18 gave it credit for; what §20.13 got wrong was the fix shape,
not the location.

This is the same wall §20.14 #6/#7 and §20.18's two share-based designs hit
from the other side. A fleet-wide join is a GPU hole *because* the seal is
wait-for-all; relaxing the quorum removes the hole but splits the fleet into
sub-cohorts that never re-merge (run-ahead lead is hysteretic, frame.rs
:1804-1820), and all four quorum designs measured worse. Moving the join
earlier, as here, just moves the hole. Both levers on the same joint are now
closed by measurement.

### Why a parked successor cannot help, structurally

A lane's run-ahead lead IS queued work. A successor that submits one frame and
then parks has its queue drained within a wave or two and rejoins lead-less —
exactly as it would have without the change — so it pays a SECOND fleet-wide
host round trip at the boundary anyway. Letting it keep submitting instead of
parking is not an option either: with 4096 processes spawned and a 1024 bind
pool that is precisely a 2x execution cap, which §20.14 #2 measured at
26543 vs 30402. And it cannot queue more than one frame regardless: frame N+1
needs frame N's sampled token, so the maximum possible pre-staged reserve is
one prefill.

### The one variant this leaves open (NOT built)

The prefill wave is 83.6 ms of GPU (p50) against a boundary hole of ~114 ms.
So a successor's prefill frame could cover most of the hole — but only if it is
submitted early and **held undispatched** until the seat opens, instead of
dispatching on arrival as it did here. That needs a new lane state in the frame
policy (frames present, not awaited, not dispatch-eligible, released on seat
acquisition and on terminate). Ceiling is 8 boundaries x 83.6 ms = 0.67 s of
16.5 s = **+4.1%**, which is ~32100 against vLLM's 32755 — still short of
parity on this arm, and it lands in the deadlock-prone part of the scheduler.
Recorded, not attempted.

### Status

REVERTED — the tree carries none of this. `park_census` /
`planner_parks_total` from §20.20 stay; `runahead_first_frames` went with the
experiment.

---

## §20.22 — the BANKED first-frame reserve: +3.6% measured, then refuted on liveness

§20.21 closed first-frame run-ahead in its *dispatching* form and left exactly
one variant open: submit the first frame early but **hold it undispatched**,
releasing it only when the GPU would otherwise stand still. That variant is now
built, measured and closed. It is a real throughput win and a structural
liveness break, and both halves are worth recording.

### What was built

A `held` lane state in the frame policy — a lane that is *present* (its frame
is assembled and counted) but neither **awaited** by the wait-all seal nor
**dispatchable** by `seal()`. A `runahead_held` process set arms it; the arm
also drops the owner's `staged` earmark, because a reserve is not a successor
the boundary should wait for (its frame is already assembled, so there is no
fire to gather).

Release had to be moved twice before it was live, and each move is a lesson:

1. **Release at slot consumption** (the obvious design) **deadlocks.** An
   unseated guest blocks on its first frame's *result*, so it never reaches the
   next `submit` that would take the seat: `seal -> result -> submit -> seat ->
   seal`. Measured 865 tok/s, 2063/4096 requests failed.
2. **Release when the GPU is idle and nothing is sealable** fixes that, but a
   banked reserve that still held its `staged` earmark blocked the boundary
   through the `joining` interlock instead — the same cycle one indirection
   out. (`[frame-stall]` in `soak`, a 120 s hang in `tinyswap`.)
3. **Final shape, and the only correct one:** release inside `plan_dispatch`
   when `!executing && (joining || missing > 0 || !have_seal_candidate())` —
   nothing is in flight *and* this boundary cannot dispatch for any reason. The
   `!executing` key is what makes it unconditional progress: releasing cannot
   reorder anything, because there is nothing in flight to reorder against.
   (Same argument the mode-2 rebind escape rests on.)

### It works, and the mechanism is confirmed

Homogeneous conc 512, 4096 requests, 8192 pages, n=5 per arm, interleaved:

```
  off  31039  31331  29975  31236  30645   mean 30845
  on   32184  31728  32025  31911  31931   mean 31956   +3.6%
```

The arms do not overlap: the on-arm's **minimum** (31728) beats the off-arm's
**maximum** (31331), 5/5 vs 5/5. The on-arm is also four times tighter (1.4% vs
4.5% spread) — consistent with the boundary hole being the variance source.
vs vLLM 32755: **0.958 -> 0.976**.

Wave decomposition of an instrumented pair (30695 off / 31414 on) confirms the
mechanism rather than a side effect:

```
  off  528 waves  24 prefill waves  idle 1.09s  (prefill 1.00  decode 0.09)
  on   528 waves  24 prefill waves  idle 0.79s  (prefill 0.57  decode 0.21)
  off top gaps  293 140 135 121  97  96  75  40 ms   (all before prefill)
  on  top gaps  326  59  39  32  31  31  30  26 ms
```

Wave count and prefill-wave count are **identical** — no fleet fragmentation,
which is what every quorum-relaxation attempt failed on. The per-turnover holes
collapse by roughly the 83.6 ms a prefill wave costs on the GPU, exactly as
§20.21 predicted. The one unchanged gap (293 -> 326 ms) is startup, where by
construction nothing has been banked yet.

### Why it cannot land: a reserve holds KV without holding a seat

Contention suite: **7 of 16 scenarios failed** (`hog` 1/32 completed, `soak`
515/4096, `tinyswap` stops evicting entirely). All three are the tightest pools
in the suite — `hog` 40 pages, `tinyswap` 128, `soak` 160.

Pairing each reserve 1:1 with a real departure (an `AtomicU64` credit
incremented where the execution seat is released in `ProcessCtx::drop`,
consumed by the run-ahead pass — an accounting identity, no constant, and zero
at startup) fixed `hog` outright, 32/32. It does **not** fix the others, and
the planner trace says why:

```
queue=18 head_pages=1 accum=0 free=0/128 resident=49 evicting=1 admitted=30
runners=[12 procs, all h4]
```

`admitted=30` against an execution cap of **16**. The credit bounds the *flow*
of new reserves; it cannot bound the *stock*, because a reserve keeps its pages
from its prefill until it eventually finishes — long after the departure that
funded it returned its own. The pool then has 0 free pages, the head ask is
1 page, and the single `evicting` process can never complete.

This is not a bug in the implementation. It is the design:

> **A banked reserve holds pooled pages without holding an execution seat. The
> KV pool is sized against the execution cap. Therefore any run-ahead that
> reaches the allocator oversubscribes the pool by construction, and no
> accounting on the run-ahead side can repair that — the extra pages are real.**

Bounding the reserve by a page budget would work, and is exactly the predicted
quantity the user has ruled out (and §20.20 already closed KV-aware admission
in both its heuristic and its structural forms).

### Status

REVERTED — the tree carries none of this.

### What is now closed

The fleet-wide join at a cohort boundary (§20.21's root cause) has three
conceivable levers, and all three are closed by measurement:

| lever | where | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| relax the seal quorum | §20.14 #6/#7 + two share-based designs | worse; the fleet splits into sub-cohorts that never re-merge |
| move the join earlier | §20.21 | -5.7%; the hole follows the join |
| bank work across the join | §20.22 (this) | +3.6%, but oversubscribes the KV pool by construction |

The remaining ~100 ms per boundary is 512 guest exits + 512 admissions + 512
first submits. Only §20.14's already-recorded shape can still attack it: make
per-process bring-up and teardown substantially cheaper, so the round trip
itself shrinks. §20.15 (submit -58%) and §20.16 (close barrier -19%) were the
first two instalments of that and were individually throughput-neutral; the
finding here is that they were attacking the right term after all, just not
enough of it to clear the noise band.

---

## §20.23 — profiling the turnover hole: it is the scheduler loop's pass time

§20.22 closed the last of the three levers on the fleet-wide join and left one
direction standing: make per-process bring-up and teardown cheap enough that
the round trip itself shrinks. This section profiles that round trip. Every
number below comes from the stock engine's own instrumentation
(`PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves`, homogeneous conc 512, 4096 requests, 8192 pages,
16.6 s wall, 528 waves, 24 of them prefill).

### It is not the GPU, not the pool, and not host parallelism

`worker_threads` sweep at conc 512 — 16 / 64 / 128 threads:

```
  31286 / 30388 / 30540 tok/s
```

Flat inside the 4.5% band, and 16 is nominally the best. The box has 128 CPUs
and the default is `min(cores, 64)`. Adding parallelism does nothing, so the
boundary is not throughput-bound: there is a **serial section**.

### The single dominant cost: a bind is 775x its own work

PAIRED per-process deltas across one 140 ms boundary (n = 512 successors):

```
  bind_started -> bind_finished (TOTAL)   p50  54.36  p90 118.95  max 131.41 ms
    of which: driver round trip           p50  54.30  p90 118.87  max 131.34 ms
    of which: host-side work              p50   0.07  p90   0.12  max   0.24 ms
```

The lane's own execution is trivial and so is the driver's:

```
  register_channels_bind occupancy   p50 0.10 ms   (8192 controls, sum 1.08 s)
  cuda_bind total                    p50 0.02 ms   (sum 0.23 s)
  cuda_channel_register (9 per bind) p50 0.00 ms   (73728 regs, sum 0.05 s)
  engine bind_us / set_us            p50 0.03 / 0.05 ms
```

### Where the 54 ms goes: arrival vs service curves

Same boundary, times relative to `t0` = the last frame's `native_complete`:

```
  A predecessor guest_main_returned    p05   4.1  p50  27.8  p95  49.8 ms
  B predecessor drop_entered           p05   4.1  p50  27.9  p95  49.8 ms
  C successor bind_admitted            p05  14.8  p50  61.9  p95 112.6 ms
  D successor exec admitted            p05  13.3  p50  61.1  p95 112.5 ms
  E successor bind_started  (SUPPLY)   p05  17.6  p50  62.1  p95 114.9 ms
  F bind control SERVICED by the lane  p05  18.3  p50  65.2  p95 197.2 ms
  G bind finished (guest observes)     p05  54.0  p50  95.0  p95 194.4 ms
```

Read it as a queue: **service (F) trails supply (E) by 3 ms.** The driver lane
is keeping up and is NOT the bottleneck — during the gap the GPU is idle, so no
frame submit is occupying the lane either. Binds arrive at only ~5/ms, and the
GPU restarts at t0+140 once essentially all of them have landed (the wait-all
seal waits for the LAST one, p95 115 ms, not the median).

So the cost is the **supply chain**, and it is a chain of round trips through
one thread. Rank-paired lane-completion to guest-observation:

```
  lane done -> guest sees bind   p50 1.3 - 13.4 ms   p95 25 - 36 ms
  bind_finished per 5 ms bucket:  50:38 55:77 60:74 65:7  [25 ms hole]  90:45 95:51 ...
```

Those holes are the loop's own pass. Its time budget over the run:

```
  loop_mailbox_us  p50  1.59  SUM  0.96 s
  loop_retire_us   p50  4.19  SUM  2.20 s
  loop_dispatch_us p50  5.16  SUM  3.94 s   (of which loop_post_us p50 4.58, SUM 2.27 s)
  loop_park_us     p50 17.55  SUM  9.73 s
  loop_lag_us      p50  5.52 ms   max 28.93 ms
  driver_submit_us p50  9.04  SUM  5.53 s   (lane thread, blocks controls behind it)
```

A pass costs mailbox + retire + dispatch ~= **14 ms**, and `loop_lag_us` p50
5.5 ms says the loop runs that far behind. Every hop a process needs —
`ExecutionSlotConsumed`, the bind post, the bind reply that resolves its
oneshot — costs up to one pass. A successor needs two or three of them, which
is exactly the ~60 ms by which curve D lags curve B, and exactly why a 50 ms
predecessor spread (A) is stretched into a 100 ms bind spread (E).

Per-guest, the same ratio shows up in the steady state:

```
  mean per-guest wake  32.2 us      mean per-guest work  0.1 us
  (249856 guest observations, guest_wake SUM 8.04 s of a 16.6 s run)
```

### What this rules out

- **The single control slot is NOT the cause.** `worker.rs` only holds the slot
  for async-completing controls; lifecycle controls (register / bind / close)
  are pipe-concurrent and flush to the lane FIFO freely in one pass.
- **A dedicated control lane would not help the gap.** During the hole the GPU
  is idle, so no frame submit is occupying the lane; binds still trickle at
  5/ms.
- **Channel registration, program registration and the CUDA bind are free**
  (sums of 0.05 s, 0.00 s and 0.23 s across the whole run).

### The lever

The boundary hole is `passes x pass_time`, and `pass_time` is ~14 ms of
single-threaded work dominated by three per-fire costs at 512 fires per frame:

```
  loop_post_us    4.58 ms  (~9 us per fire)   building and posting the frame
  loop_retire_us  4.19 ms  (~8 us per fire)   retiring it
  loop_dispatch_us 5.16 ms                    the queue scan + seal + post
```

Cutting per-fire host cost shortens every hop of every process at every
boundary, and it also shortens `loop_lag_us` in the steady state. This is the
same term §20.15 (submit -58%) and §20.16 (close barrier -19%) attacked; the
finding here is that they were aimed correctly but were each too small a slice
of a 14 ms pass to clear a 4.5% noise band. The measurement to hold them to is
`loop_lag_us` and the A..G curve above, NOT end-to-end tok/s.

### Addendum: the box has 13 CPUs, not 128

`std::thread::available_parallelism()` returns **13** here — it reads the cgroup
quota (`cpu.cfs_quota_us 1360000 / cpu.cfs_period_us 100000` = 13.6 CPUs),
while `nproc` and `os.cpu_count()` both report 128. The engine's default
`min(available_parallelism, 64)` is therefore **13 worker threads, not 64**, and
the sweep above was testing 1.2x and 2.4x OVERSUBSCRIPTION against a hard
quota — which is exactly why more threads got slower. Stock is already
correctly sized; the sweep still rules out parallelism as the lever, but for
the opposite reason to the one first assumed.

This also sharpens the diagnosis: the scheduler loop is ONE dedicated thread
running ~10 ms passes on a 13-CPU budget. Per-fire host cost in that loop is
not merely a constant factor — it is the critical path's clock.

### Refuted while profiling: instantiation is NOT in the hole

WASM bring-up was the other candidate for the boundary cost, since
`process_instantiated.instantiate_us` sums to 9.18 s of a 16.6 s run and
`get_component_us` shows a p50 9 us / p90 2.15 ms lock-contention shape. It is
not in the hole. All 4096 instantiations complete within the first **836 ms**
of the run, and at each of the four largest boundaries the count of
instantiations starting inside the hole is **zero** (the nearest cohort's
instantiations run 1.9 - 10.5 s earlier). Prewarm is doing its job: the
double-buffered cohort is fully instantiated long before it is needed.

Teardown is likewise not the work — `terminate_ack` p50 0.00 ms, `finalize`
p50 0.00 ms — but the teardown TASK waits p50 18.6 ms / p90 40.9 ms just to be
first polled, with **170 (p50) to 424 (peak)** tasks spawned-but-unpolled at a
boundary. That is the 13-CPU budget, not a lock.

### Landed: post_frame's per-fire hash traffic (-20% loop_post)

`post_frame` rebuilt its fire-id maps twice per frame: a `wave_of` map hashed
once per queued launch for `contains_key` and again for the index, then a
SECOND per-wave `order` map that the sort comparator hashed into on every
comparison — n log n lookups (~4600 at 512 fires) on the loop's hottest path.
One map now carries `(wave, position)` together, so the sort compares plain
integers.

Paired instrumented runs, same session, 528 waves each:

```
                     OLD        NEW      delta
  loop_post_us      4.682 ms   3.733 ms  -20.3%
  loop_dispatch_us  5.301 ms   4.344 ms  -18.1%
  loop_retire_us    4.124 ms   4.172 ms   +1.2%  (untouched)
  loop_mailbox_us   1.568 ms   1.607 ms   +2.5%  (untouched)
  batch_build_us    1.575 ms   1.596 ms   +1.3%  (untouched)
```

The untouched phases moving <2.5% is the control: the delta is the change, not
the run. End-to-end tok/s could NOT resolve it — this box was running at load
15 against a 13.6-CPU quota that day and homogeneous 512 spread 28131..31296
(11%) across three back-to-back runs. Per §20.23 the measurement to hold this
class of change to is the loop phase itself.


## §20.24 DONE — the retire cost was the ALLOCATOR; mimalloc landed, reaper rejected

§20.23 left `loop_retire_us` at ~4.2 ms (~8 us/fire) as the last unattacked
half of candidate 1. Instrumenting it (new `retire_instances/mark/resolve/
drop/emit` sub-phases on `LoopPhaseAcc`, behind `fire_timing_enabled()`, kept)
localised it precisely:

```
  loop_retire_us      p50 4.155 ms   SUM 2.181 s   4.16 us/fire
    retire_instances      0.041 ms                 hash lookups
    retire_mark           0.012 ms
    retire_resolve        0.941 ms                 terminal load + wake
    retire_drop           2.771 ms   SUM 1.443 s   <- 67%
    retire_emit           0.300 ms
```

The resolve loop consumed `retired.requests` BY VALUE, so it ran 512
destructors inline. A `PendingRequest` owns a `LaunchPlan` — thirty-odd
`Vec`s plus `LaunchStagePlan { ops, source_ops: Vec<Vec<u32>>, value_types }`.
**The scheduler loop spent 1.44 s of a 16.6 s run inside `free`, on the one
thread that is the critical path for every process hop at a cohort boundary.**

### FIRST ATTEMPT: a reaper thread — REJECTED BY MEASUREMENT
Moved the retired vector to a `std::thread` over a `crossbeam::bounded(
configured_max_in_flight())` with inline-drop overflow. Sound (nothing in the
drop chain releases a scheduling resource; only pool returns). It did exactly
what it was built to do — `retire_drop_us` 2.77 -> 0.007 ms — and bought
nothing, because `loop_post_us` +23% and `batch_build_us` +45% ate it. That
regression was the CLUE: a thread that never frees stops replenishing its own
allocator cache.

### ROOT CAUSE: `mimalloc` was a declared dependency that was NEVER REGISTERED
`worker/Cargo.toml` has carried `mimalloc = "0.1"` since the disaggregated-
serving refactor (cc4e77a7d) with no `#[global_allocator]` anywhere in the
workspace. The engine has been running on glibc malloc, whose per-arena lock
is exactly the wrong shape for "one thread allocates 512 plans, then frees 512
plans, ~20k `free` calls per pass".

### THE 2x2 (one build, both axes env-gated; conc 512, N=4096, 2 reps)
```
                       tok/s     retire_drop  loop_retire  loop_lag  TRUE-IDLE
  glibc,  reaper off   30918        2.92 ms      4.29 ms    5.65 ms   1.006 s
  mimalloc,reaper off  31246        0.78 ms      1.90 ms    4.10 ms   0.840 s
  mimalloc,reaper on   31230        0.007ms      1.15 ms    3.82 ms   0.789 s
  glibc,  reaper on    30808        0.008ms      1.45 ms    3.91 ms   0.994 s
```
The allocator arms DO NOT OVERLAP (mimalloc min 31050 > glibc max 30927 over
4 runs each). The reaper adds nothing once the allocator is right, and costs a
thread on a 13.6-CPU box. **Reaper reverted; mimalloc landed.**

### LANDED
`#[global_allocator] static GLOBAL_ALLOC: mimalloc::MiMalloc` in
`worker/src/lib.rs` — the one crate the CLI, the standalone worker and the
pyo3 wheel all link, so a single declaration covers every entry point.
Feature `local_dynamic_tls` is REQUIRED: the wheel is `dlopen()`ed and
mimalloc's default initial-exec TLS model fails there with "cannot allocate
memory in static TLS block".

### RESULT (landed build, n=3, vs the glibc arm of the same 2x2)
```
  retire_drop_us    2.924 -> 0.807 ms   -72%
  loop_retire_us    4.295 -> 1.944 ms   -55%
  loop_lag_us       5.649 -> 3.879 ms   -31%   <- §20.23's target metric
  loop_post_us      3.628 -> 3.462 ms    -5%   (untouched = CONTROL)
  loop_mailbox_us   1.575 -> 1.479 ms    -6%   (untouched = CONTROL)
  TRUE-IDLE         1.006 -> 0.813 s    -19%
  top boundary gaps 198/138/112/109 -> 163/128/98/88 ms
  tok/s             30918 -> 31380      +1.5%
```
`driver_submit_us` rose 9.57 -> 11.25 ms, but that is the LANE thread and
§20.23 already showed the lane keeps up (it services a bind 3 ms after it is
posted); throughput and idle both moved the right way.

VARIANCE IS THE OTHER HEADLINE: three back-to-back runs read 31339/31431/
31371 = **0.3% spread**, against the 11% spread (28131/28999/31296) that
§20.23 recorded as this box's noise floor. Much of what was called machine
noise was glibc arena contention. This also explains the `guest_wake_us`
multi-second maxima seen while chasing the reaper (10.3 s in one glibc run):
they were allocator stalls, not a scheduling defect.

VERIFIED: frame tests 25 pass / 2 pre-existing fail; contention hog 32/32,
soak 4096/4096, tinyswap 3/3, allshared_noswap 128/128 x3, churn_extreme
4096/4096 x4.

### NEXT
 1. `loop_dispatch_us` (3.96 ms) and `loop_post_us` (3.46 ms) are now the two
    largest phases; `retire_resolve_us` (0.79 ms) is the rest of retire.
 2. The 33 ms from predecessor `drop_entered` to successor `exec admitted`
    still stands: teardown tasks wait p50 18.6 ms to be FIRST POLLED with
    170-424 spawned-but-unpolled tasks at a boundary.

## §20.25 — post_frame placement, and where the idle ACTUALLY is

### The change: place by slot instead of push-then-sort
`post_frame` picked each queued fire into `Vec<(usize, PendingRequest)>` and
then `sort_by_key`'d it back into the sealed wave's order. `PendingRequest`
is **1280 bytes** (`LaunchPlan` alone is 1024), so that sort swapped 1288-byte
elements n log n times — several MB of `memmove` per frame. But `position` is
already a permutation of `0..wave.len()`, so the order is recovered by writing
each request straight into its slot: one move per fire, no comparisons. The
survivor filter then folds into the compaction pass, and the slot buffer is
owned by the loop (`SlotBuffer`) so steady state neither allocates nor refills.

```
                  BEFORE      AFTER    delta
  loop_post_us     3.506 ms   2.700 ms  -23.0%
    post_sort        0.955 ms   (gone)
    post_filter      0.533 ms   0.598 ms   (absorbs compaction)
    post_drain       0.401 ms   0.409 ms
  loop_dispatch_us 4.000 ms   3.282 ms  -17.9%
  loop_lag_us      3.803 ms   3.154 ms  -17.0%
```

**Throughput: unchanged (31407 -> 31173, inside noise).** Kept anyway: an
n log n sort of 1.3 KB payloads to recover an order that was already known is
simply the wrong algorithm. But the fact that it bought NOTHING is the real
result of this section.

### Why it bought nothing: the loop was never the constraint
GPU idle is not spread across the run. Of **528 waves, only 27 have any idle
at all** — 501 waves have exactly zero. And the big ones land on waves

```
  66, 132, 198, 264, 330, 396, 462      <- every 66 waves, exactly
```

4096 requests / 512 concurrency = 8 cohorts; 528 waves / 8 = 66. **These are
the seven cohort boundaries, and they carry 614 ms of the run's 784 ms of
idle (78%).** Cutting `loop_lag_us` from 5.65 ms (§20.23) to 3.15 ms moved the
boundary gap by 3% (161 -> 156 ms) and total idle not at all. The scheduler
loop keeps up on 95% of waves; shaving its pass time is finished as a lever.

### Anatomy of a boundary (wave 330, 122.9 ms, all 512 processes)
```
  +0.8 .. +38.6 ms   512 old guests return from main and drop
  +13.5 ms (p50)     drop entered  (scratch_rm 7 us, permit release 12 us)
  +44.8 ms (p50)     teardown task FIRST POLLED   <- +31 ms of nothing
  +44.5 ms (p50)     successor exec-admitted (p10 +18.0, p90 +59.4)
  +122.9 ms          the frame finally dispatches
```
The successors were already warm: `instantiate` / `guest_main_entered` ran at
**-10.2 s** and `bind_admitted` at **-2.0 s**. Prewarm and bind are NOT on the
boundary path. The whole cost is retirement -> readmission -> first fire.

### It is NOT CPU saturation (measured, since perf/eBPF are unavailable here)
Sampling `/proc/<pid>/task/*/schedstat` at 200 Hz through a run:
```
                   cores busy (of 13.6)   runqueue wait
  steady state         3.6 - 5.5              0.00
  cohort boundary      9.0 - 10.1             0.00 - 0.01
```
Runqueue wait is zero: nothing is starved of a core. But a spawned teardown
task still waits **p50 17.0 ms / p90 30.5 ms** to be first polled. That is
queueing INSIDE tokio — ~1500 tasks become runnable at once and each worker
walks its local queue — not the OS.

The boundary carries roughly 9.3 cores x 84 ms = **0.8 s of CPU for 512
turnovers, i.e. ~1.5 ms of CPU per process turnover**, at only 68% of the
quota. Two levers follow, and they are the next work:
 1. cut the per-turnover CPU (the teardown task's `drop(context)` — the
    wasmtime `ResourceTable` — is *unmeasured*: `released_us` is written
    before it; and there are 18 `cuda_channel_register` per process);
 2. raise boundary parallelism from 9.3 to 13.6 cores.

VERIFIED: frame 25 pass / 2 pre-existing fail; hog 32/32, soak 4096/4096,
tinyswap 3/3, allshared_noswap 128/128 x3, churn_extreme 4096/4096 x4.

## §20.26 — the boundary decomposed, two queue defects fixed, and the probe
## that was measuring itself

§20.25 localised every bit of GPU idle to the seven cohort boundaries (614 ms
of 784 ms). This section takes a boundary apart with per-thread CPU
attribution and per-phase scheduler instrumentation, lands two correctness
fixes found on the way, and ends by removing an observer effect large enough
to have distorted the very numbers below.

### Per-thread CPU attribution

`/proc/<pid>/task/*/schedstat` sampled at 200 Hz and grouped by thread `comm`
(`/root/p512/thread_sampler.py`):

```
                   TOTAL   tokio   pie-sched-0   pie-driver-0   runq wait
  steady state    4.4-5.0  2.1-2.6   0.25-0.33      1.1-2.1        0.00
  cohort boundary 8.0-9.2  5.9-7.3   0.87-0.96      0.6-0.9        0.00
```

Two facts follow. `pie-sched-0` is a **single** thread and it runs at 90-96%
of a core through a boundary, four times its steady-state draw. And steady
state uses only **4.4-5.0 of the 13.6-CPU quota** — there is no shortage of
capacity, the turnover work simply happens at a moment when the GPU has
nothing else to do.

Re-swept worker threads at the post-mimalloc 0.3% noise floor to be sure
oversubscription is not the lever: 13 / 20 / 26 / 40 threads gave
31286 / 31186 / 31287 / 31058 tok/s. Flat, third confirmation.

### What `pie-sched-0` was doing: 320,645 rotations per boundary

Per-wave loop phases, boundary vs steady:

```
  loop_passes  1187 vs 4      loop_scans   976 vs 1     loop_items 8599 vs 1024
  loop_dispatch 119 ms vs 3.6  loop_park 0.26 ms vs 20.7
```

scan + plan + post + batch_build accounted for 9.5 of the 119 ms, so new
`disp_*` sub-phase counters were added inside `dispatch_ready_items`. They
found **`disp_rot_n` = 320,645 close-rotations per boundary** (max 779,642)
against 0 in steady state. `PendingQueue` bumps an epoch on every `&mut`
reach, so each rotation invalidates `ScanCache` and forces a full
`scan_queue` — hence `loop_scans` 976.

Reading that code found two defects, both fixed:

 1. the `!busy` branch **fell through into the rotation**. A close that
    dispatched successfully then rotated the *next* item — possibly a Launch —
    to the back of the queue. The comment on the rotation says "Busy: rotate".
    Now `continue`s.
 2. a pure rotation claimed `progress = true`, so the run loop treated
    "I moved an item" as "I did work" and never parked. The adjacent
    `hold_closes` branch documents the opposite ("no progress claim"). `busy`
    already guarantees a later wake, so the claim is now dropped.

`QueuedItem` was also 1280 bytes (`PendingRequest` inline), so every rotation
memcpy'd 1280 bytes twice; 320k rotations is ~820 MB of memcpy. Boxing the
payload (`Launch(Box<PendingRequest>)`, threaded through `SlotBuffer`,
`collisions`, `survivors`, `PendingLaunchBatch` and all of `scheduler/batch.rs`)
took it to **376 bytes**: `loop_post_us` 5143 -> 3003 (-42%), `loop_lag_us`
844 -> 570.

**But `loop_dispatch_us` did not move** (~114 ms) and rotations rose to 571k.
The rotation is a busy-wait that expands to fill the boundary; it is a
symptom, not the cause. Both changes are kept because each is independently
correct, not because either moved the benchmark (31247 / 31134 vs ~31200).

### The boundary's actual critical path

Lifecycle event distributions over four boundaries, t0 = start of the gap:

```
  guest_main_returned   p10  4.2   p50 18.8   p90 43.9   max 48.2
  process_store_drop    (identical -- the permit is released 5 us in)
  process_admitted      p10 22.8   p50 51.5   p90 66.8   max 70.6
  FRAME DISPATCHES                                            82.9
```

So **58% of a boundary is the 512 old guests returning from `run()`**, then a
uniform ~20 ms release->admit lag, then ~12 ms to seal and dispatch.

Hypotheses killed here:
 - the planner lock and the bind gate are innocent: instrumented
   `note_us` p50 **4 us**, `bind_wait_us` p50 **0** (max 17 us).
 - tokio's global injection queue is real but not the lever. Guests are woken
   from non-runtime threads, so every wake lands in the global queue;
   `global_queue_interval=1` cut the exit spread 50.4 -> 39.2 ms (-22%) and
   total idle 0.881 -> 0.842 s, but throughput was neutral and **`lastAdmit`
   stayed at 69-71 ms in every arm**. Reverted: it is a tuning constant that
   buys nothing.

The ~70 ms admit floor not moving when the exits are compressed is the open
question this section leaves.

### The probe was measuring itself

`fire_timing_write` formatted each record and then took the **process-wide
`stderr` lock and issued one `write` syscall, inline, on the emitting
thread**. `PIE_FIRE_TIMING=waves` drops the per-fire stream but keeps the
per-process lifecycle stream, which is ~28 records per process: a 512-lane
boundary pushes **~14,000 locked syscalls through a single mutex**, paid by
the guest, scheduler and driver-lane threads at once — landing exactly on the
window the stream exists to measure. §20.23's "instrumentation costs 1.1% of
the run" is true and misleading: 1.1% of 16.3 s is 180 ms, and essentially
all of it is concentrated in the 7 boundaries.

Records now go to a dedicated `pie-fire-timing` writer thread over an
unbounded channel and are batched into a 1 MB `BufWriter` that flushes
whenever the producers go quiet, so a burst costs one syscall instead of
14,000 and no producer ever blocks on another. `SchedulerShutdownHandle::
shutdown` flushes synchronously so a benchmark reading the stream after exit
still sees the tail. Ordering is preserved: one consumer writes.

### ★ The fix inverts the diagnosis: the boundary IS CPU-saturated

Every "the boundary is not CPU-bound" reading in §20.25 and above was taken
through the inline-stderr probe, and it was the probe that was serialising
the runtime. Re-measured with the writer thread (`/root/p512/pf1.th`):

```
                   TOTAL (of 13.6)   tokio-rt-worker (13 threads)
  steady state          3.0                 0.6 - 0.95
  cohort boundary     14 - 17               11 - 13
```

At a boundary **every one of the 13 tokio workers is running**, and total
demand exceeds the 13.6-CPU cgroup quota. §20.25's "9.0-10.1 cores, runqueue
wait 0.00" and this segment's earlier "tokio 5.9-7.3 of 13" were both
artefacts: threads were blocked on the `stderr` mutex, which schedstat scores
as neither run time nor runqueue wait.

Corroborating, `process_admitted` and `process_store_drop` now carry the
emitting `tid`: at every boundary both are spread across **all 13 workers**,
40-63 each. There is no serial section.

The boundary is therefore, precisely:

```
  512 turnovers x ~1.5 ms of host CPU each / 13 cores = ~60 ms
```

and the admit "rate limit" of 8.5/ms is simply 13 cores divided by 1.5 ms of
work per turnover. A free-permit census settles that it is not a dependency:
**150-270 execution seats sit unclaimed for the entire boundary** (releases
complete at t=40-45 ms, admits run to t=60-65 ms), so nothing is waiting on a
predecessor — the successors are waiting for a core.

Of the ~871 core-ms in a 67 ms boundary window, the instrumented per-process
costs account for only ~215:

```
  store drop (wasmtime Store + ProcessCtx)   92 ms    p50 0.147 ms
  control_dispatched occupancy               54 ms
  ResourceTable drop                         22 ms
  permit release + scratch_rm                12 ms
  note_admitted / detach / terminate / ...    ~9 ms
```

The remaining ~650 core-ms is uninstrumented, and finding it is the next
step: it is almost certainly guest-side WASM (the retiring cohort's epilogue
and the successors' first-frame prologue), which no host timer can see.

This also re-frames the whole §20.14 shape: "make per-process bring-up and
teardown cheaper" is not a latency problem, it is a **CPU budget** problem.
Steady-state decode uses 3.0 of 13.6 cores, so the machine has ~10 spare
cores during decode and none at all at the boundary.

## §20.27 — the boundary ROTATION STORM, and the conc-1024 page correction

Two findings. One is a performance defect in the dispatch loop that cost up
to 220 ms of the scheduler thread per cohort boundary; the other is that
every "conc 1024 regressed" reading in this document since §20.18 was taken
at the wrong page count.

### ★ The defect: `dispatch_ready_items` rotated the whole queue, per pass

At a cohort boundary the loop holds closes so a pending bind can jump them:

```rust
let hold_closes = !stopping && frame_policy.has_pending_binds();
```

Both held-close branches then rotated the front close to the back and asked
whether to keep going. The question they asked was:

```rust
!pending.iter().skip(1).any(|item| !matches!(item, CloseInstance | CloseChannels))
```

— "is anything that is not a close still behind me?" At a boundary the queue
is `[held closes …, the next cohort's Launches …]`, so the answer is
permanently yes and the loop rotated **the entire queue, every wake**.

Measured on `scheduler_wave` records (`disp_rot_n`, new this segment):

```
                          rotations in one       boundary
                          inter-wave interval    loop_dispatch_us
  conc 512  (8192 pages)   492k - 1,198k          103 - 220 ms
  conc 1024 (8192 pages)   6,629,194 per RUN         —
  steady state                 ~0                  2 - 3 ms
```

`QueuedItem` is 376 bytes, so 1.2 M `pop_front`+`push_back` is ~900 MB of
`memmove` on the single scheduler thread, inside the GPU hole. Only the
`rot_stop` *scan* was timed (`disp_rot_us` 20-94 ms); the moves themselves
were untimed, which is where the rest of `loop_dispatch_us` went. Each
rotation also bumps `PendingQueue::epoch`, invalidating `ScanCache` and
forcing an O(n) re-walk in `dispatch_frame_work` on every pass on top.

### The fix is exact, not a bound

`Self::rotation_target` names the items a rotation can usefully expose at the
FRONT. Three kinds are excluded because they dispatch without ever reaching
the front:

- `Launch` — `dispatch_frame_work` picks by `logical_fire_id` from a
  full-queue scan, never by queue position.
- standalone copies (`CopyKv` / `CopyKvTracked` / `CopyState`) — the tail
  sweep at the end of `dispatch_ready_items` pulls them from any position.
  `PreLaunchCopy` is deliberately NOT one of these: it is order-coupled to
  its consumer fire, so it stays a rotation target.
- closes — this predicate is only asked while the WHOLE close run is held,
  and exposing one held close behind another dispatches nothing.

Liveness is unchanged because `queue_bind_control` inserts a bind BEFORE the
first close. With the closes now resting at the front instead of churning,
an arriving bind lands at index 0 and dispatches on the next pass — which is
required, since `hold_closes` is true precisely because binds are pending.

The **busy** (non-held) rotation branch keeps its original predicate: there,
rotating can expose a different, non-busy close, which is real progress.
`disp_busy_n` at a boundary is 440-592, i.e. the busy arm was never the
storm.

### Result

```
                       rotations/run    boundary loop_dispatch_us
  conc 512   before      ~3.5 M            103 - 220 ms
             after        10,109            24 -  37 ms
  conc 1024  before     6,629,194              —
             after         13,498             4 -  10 ms
```

`disp_frame_us` (`dispatch_frame_work`) is now the largest boundary dispatch
term at 16.9-30.6 ms (conc 512) and 35-45 ms (conc 1024).

### ★ The conc-1024 parity pool is 16384 pages, not 8192

conc 1024 had been measured at `--total-pages 8192` — the conc-512 pool —
which is 8 pages per lane and genuinely starves:

```
  conc 1024 @  8192   planner_parks_total 11,814   parked_now p50 34
  conc  512 @  8192   planner_parks_total      0
```

767-793 waves instead of 524, 28% GPU idle, and BOTH engines depressed. The
proof that 16384 is the parity point is vLLM's own number: at 16384 it reads
31353, which matches the 31367 recorded against pie's 32110 back in §20.18.

Interleaved A/B on the fixed engine (v then p, alternating, one process at a
time — this box carries foreign load, so only interleaved ratios are usable):

```
  conc  512 @  8192   pie 31123 31527 31714   vLLM 32842 32692 32731   0.960
  conc 1024 @ 16384   pie 32203 31959         vLLM 30677 31186         1.037
```

**conc 1024 is won.** conc 512 still runs 4% behind, and the arithmetic says
why: 4096 requests at 1024 lanes is 4 cohorts (3 boundaries), at 512 lanes it
is 8 cohorts (7 boundaries), against a nearly identical wall. conc 512 pays
the boundary tax twice as often. The boundary is the whole remaining deficit.

## §20.28 — cohort-boundary and startup: three admission fixes plus the
## queue-walk fix; the boundary is guest-CPU bound, not loop bound

Four changes land here. Three (A, B, D) attack the cohort boundary and the
startup ramp through the spawn admission ladder; one (E) removes two O(n)
queue walks from the worker loop. Two more (H, and pacing) were built or
designed, measured, and rejected.

Each of A/B/D carries an env switch (default on) so the arms can be A/B'd in
one build: `PIE_BIND_DEFER`, `PIE_PREWARM_HOLD`, `PIE_BIND_STAGE_LAZY`.

### A — hold bind releases across a joining boundary

`ProcessCtx::drop` frees the execution seat synchronously (§20.14) and hands
the bind permit to `defer_resource_teardown`. Releasing that bind permit
immediately admits the *next* cohort's bind at exactly the moment the frame
is trying to seal, so the driver lane and the loop carry a fleet-wide bring-up
storm in front of the wave that is holding everything up.

The permit is now parked in `HELD_BIND_PERMITS` while
`FramePolicy::is_joining()` holds, and released when it clears. The hold is
asserted once per scheduler pass in `worker.rs` and cleared unconditionally on
any pass with no progress, no `in_flight_launches` and no `in_flight_control`,
so it can never be the last thing standing.

*Liveness*: a process parked on bind admission can never be what a join is
waiting for. `joins_in_flight` is populated at `on_execution_slot_consumed`,
which is downstream of bind admission on the same task — bind is always
acquired before execution.

This also fixed a pre-existing **bind-permit leak**: the `std::mem::forget`
no-runtime path in `teardown.rs` dropped the context without ever returning
the permit.

```
  binds now land 10-35 ms AFTER their cohort's admissions (were simultaneous)
  main boundary gap  78 -> 53 ms
```

### B — the prewarm permit is held through bind admission

`ensure_bind_admitted` released the prewarm permit *before* parking for a bind
seat, so the prewarm pool was a starting gun rather than a conveyor: all 4096
processes instantiated and compiled at t=0, smearing cohort 0's prologue
across the whole ramp. The permit is now released *after* the bind permit is
won, and the pool is sized to one cohort instead of `min(n, 64)`.

```
  instantiations in the first second   4096 -> 1536
  instantiate complete                 0.309 -> 0.095 s
  first GPU wave                       0.295 -> 0.226 s
```

### D — the staged half of the bind pool opens lazily

Bind admission is sized at `n * (1 + STAGED_COHORTS)` so a staged cohort can
build while the current one runs. At t=0 there is no current cohort, so the
1024-deep pool let the staged half run its reserve and prefill build alongside
cohort 0 and pushed cohort 0's own bind->execution-admit delta to 155 ms p50.

The semaphore now starts at one cohort; the staged half is parked in
`BIND_STAGED_RESERVE` and added by `open_staged_bind_pool()` the first time
execution admission finds `available_permits() == 0` — i.e. exactly when a
staged cohort first has something to stage behind.

```
  cohort 0 bind -> execution admit    155 -> ~50 ms
  first GPU wave                      0.226 -> 0.157 s   (0.295 originally)
```

### A+B+D measured together

Interleaved 3-arm A/B, 3 reps each, conc 512 @ 8192, one process at a time:

```
  off (all three disabled)  31918.8  30915.0  31442.0   mean 31425
  bd  (B+D only)            31790.5  31187.0  31255.0   mean 31411
  all (A+B+D)               32097.6  32060.0  31963.7   mean 32040   +2.0%
```

The arms do not overlap, and the `off` arm reproduces the historical
pre-change baseline (31123-31767), so it is a valid control. **B+D alone
measures as `off`** — the startup fix only converts once A stops the bring-up
storm from re-filling the boundary.

```
  conc 512 @ 8192   pie 31686 (n=3)   vLLM 32602 (n=3)   0.960 -> 0.972
```

### E — two O(n) queue walks per worker pass

`rotate_launch_for_wave_work` asked `pending.iter().skip(1).find(|i| !Launch)`
on *every* pass, and `queue_bind_control` asked
`pending.iter().position(first close)` on every queued control. At a cohort
boundary `pending` is a run of ~2200 launches held back by an unsealed frame,
and the loop makes ~12,000 passes across the seven boundaries, so the first
walk alone was ~208 ms/run — measured as the largest single per-pass cost.

`PendingQueue` now caches both offsets against the same epoch that guards
`ScanCache`, and the launch-run rotation is one `VecDeque::rotate_left`
instead of thousands of individual `pop_front`/`push_back` pairs.
`insert_before_closes` updates the close offset in place (an insert shifts the
close run right by one), so a burst of 512 binds does not rescan.

```
                          run total    7 boundaries
  dispatch walk   before    325 ms        241 ms
                  after     181 ms        131 ms     -44% / -46%
  loop_dispatch   before   1663 ms        341 ms
                  after    1588 ms        227 ms            -33%
```

*** AND THE BOUNDARY GAP DID NOT MOVE ***

```
  boundary cluster sums (ms), 7 per run, sorted
    before   38 40 43 44 52 60 110  |  35 38 41 43 52 52 111
    after    36 38 41 44 45 57 110  |  34 35 38 41 41 51 127
  loop passes at the boundaries   11-14 k  ->  15-17 k   (UP)
```

The loop made *more* passes for less work: at a boundary it is spinning while
it waits for guests, not falling behind. This is the third independent
confirmation (with §20.25's `loop_lag` result) that **shaving the scheduler
loop is a closed lever**. Kept anyway — it is strictly less work, provably
equivalent, and it returns ~150 ms of a core to a 13.6-CPU budget.

### ★ WHAT THE BOUNDARY ACTUALLY IS (CPU census, conc 512)

Per-class CPU inside the seven boundary windows, from the `cpu_census`
records (10 ms buckets):

```
  bnd   gap    guest  teardown  process   cores used
    1    57 ms  290 ms   55 ms   527 ms      9.3
    2    38     229      45      327         8.5
    3    45     335      38      439         9.8
    4    44     244      48      346         7.8
    5   110     510      60      638         5.8
    6    41     210      59      308         7.5
    7    36     224      61      328         9.2
  SUM  370 ms  2041 ms  365 ms  2913 ms      7.9 of 13.6
```

Three facts follow, and they redirect the search:

1. **The boundary is CPU, not latency.** 2.91 core-s of real work compressed
   into 370 ms. Runqueue wait is zero (§20.25), so nothing is *waiting* on the
   OS.
2. **74% of it is guest CPU** — 2.04 core-s, ~285 us per process turnover.
   Teardown is 0.37 core-s and the loop is the remainder.
3. **Parallel efficiency is 58%** (7.9 of 13.6 cores). Half the gap is the
   dependency chain, half is the CPU itself.

Successors are *not* cold: at every boundary they entered `guest_main` ~4 s
earlier and were bind-admitted ~2 s earlier, so the prologue up to the
admission gate is long done. What lands in the window is the post-gate submit
work of 512 successors and the epilogue of 512 predecessors.

### H — REJECTED: yielding after each frame submit

Hypothesis: a guest resuming at a boundary fills its whole `channel-capacity()`
window (7 cells = 3 frames at k=2) in one uninterrupted poll, but the frame it
is holding up seals on the *first* frame of every lane; so lane 512 does not
submit frame 1 until lane 511 has submitted all three. 512 x 6 x 66 us of the
census's 293 ms/boundary of guest CPU matched.

Built as a `tokio::task::yield_now()` after `submit_frame` (a fairness rule,
not a tuned constant; `submit` always carries a whole frame so a yield can
never split one). **Both metrics got worse:**

```
                  boundary gaps (ms)              guest CPU   total CPU
  yield off   39 40 41 41 41 49 104  med 41       2048 ms     2764 ms
  yield on    38 48 49 50 52 60 276  med 50       2700 ms     3814 ms
```

The per-submit reschedule costs more than the reordering saves (~200 k yields
per run), and the boundary gap grew with it. The hypothesis is refuted, not
merely unprofitable: if the seal had been waiting on the window fill, guest CPU
inside the window would have *fallen*. Reverted; the tree carries none of it.

### Also considered and not built: pacing A's drain

A's gate drains all 512 held permits at once when it opens, and at the first
boundary of one trace that burst pushed two waves'
`launch_returned - dispatch_started` to 154 and 172 ms (steady state ~12 ms).
Worth up to ~1.1%. Every constant-free pacing rule tried fails: one-per-pass
is too slow (~360 passes per generation against 512 permits); gating on
`has_pending_binds()` does not help because the permits are already out when
the gate opens; one-per-`on_bind_completed` is fully serial. Left open.

### Where the remaining ~2.8% at conc 512 is

```
  7 boundary clusters   ~355 ms   2.2%
  startup ramp          ~ 85 ms   0.5%    (first wave 0.157 s vs vLLM 0.073 s)
  everything else       GPU-bound parity (92.7% busy, decode +1.1% vs vLLM)
```

Removing the boundary entirely is worth ~1.01x, not more: pie's per-step
advantage over vLLM at this width is the whole remaining margin. The lever
that is still open and now correctly aimed is **cut per-turnover guest CPU**
(285 us x 1024 processes per boundary), and raise the boundary's parallel
efficiency above 58%.

## §20.29 — the cohort boundary is per-request turnover CPU, and that is
## architectural; conc 1024 is won at 1.046x, conc 512 sits at 0.980x

Two small orderings land here. The value of the section is the anatomy: the
boundary has now been decomposed link by link and every link is accounted for,
which closes several standing hypotheses and identifies what is left as a
property of the design rather than of the scheduler.

### Landed: nothing precedes the seat release in `ProcessCtx::drop`

The drop removed the process scratch directory and moved the `ResourceTable`
*before* releasing the execution permit, putting a `remove_dir_all` syscall —
512 of them at a cohort boundary — between the last token and the successor's
admission. The release is now the first thing the drop does, and the scratch
directory is torn down with the rest of the resources in the deferred teardown
task. Measured neutral (the syscall is ~20 us, so ~10 ms of a 16.4 s run,
below this box's noise floor); kept because the ordering is the contract the
drop's own comment states.

### The boundary, link by link (conc 512, all times relative to the last
### wave of the retiring generation)

```
  guest drain loop ends   p10  3.0   p50 11.5   p90 22 ms
  main returns            p10  3.1   p50 11.6   p90 22 ms   (+0.07 ms)
  ProcessCtx::drop entered                      +0.01 ms
  execution seat released                       immediately
  successor admitted      p10 13     p50 27     p90 35 ms
  last admit -> frame dispatches                +1.5 - 2.5 ms
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  boundary gap                                   37 - 50 ms
```

Everything after the guest's last channel `take` is free: `pipeline.close()`
drains in **3 us p50 with zero pending fires** (the run-ahead window is always
already settled at close), and close-to-return is 72 us. The seat handoff is
free (§20.14). The frame seals 2 ms after the last admission.

So the gap is two spreads and nothing else:

1. **512 guests waking to their final token** — 3 to 22 ms.
2. **512 successors waking to a freed seat** — a flat ~15 ms behind (1).

### What those spreads are: CPU, at 58% parallel efficiency

From the `cpu_census` records, inside the seven boundary windows:

```
  guest    2.04 core-s     74%
  teardown 0.37 core-s     13%
  total    2.91 core-s   in 370 ms of wall  =  7.9 of 13.6 cores
```

~285 us of guest CPU per process turnover, 1024 turnovers per boundary. At
perfect parallelism 2.91 core-s would take 214 ms; it takes 370 ms, because
successors cannot start until predecessors release seats. Both halves are
real: half the gap is the CPU, half is the dependency chain.

**This is the architectural cost of per-request programmability.** vLLM retires
a request with a few dictionary operations inside one Python scheduler step;
pie retires a WASM guest task and brings up another, and 285 us x 1024 is
36 ms of unavoidable work whenever a whole fleet turns over at once. The
benchmark makes every request the same length, so every boundary is fleet-wide;
a workload with varied lengths has no such boundary at all.

### Closed again, by measurement, at the new noise floor

`--worker-threads` was swept three times before mimalloc, when this box's noise
floor was 11%. Re-run at the current 0.5% floor, it still says the stock
sizing is right — and confirms the boundary's idle cores are the dependency
chain, not a thread shortage:

```
  13 (default, = available_parallelism)   32075
  20                                      31574
  26                                      31904
```

### Standing

Interleaved, one process at a time, alternating engines:

```
  conc 1024 @ 16384   pie 32565 32777   vLLM 30894 31565   = 1.046   WON
  conc  512 @  8192   pie 32042 32140 31937   vLLM 32655 32763 32648   = 0.980
```

conc 1024 improved from 1.037 (§20.27) and conc 512 from 0.960.

At conc 512 the remaining deficit and the remaining idle are now the same
quantity, which is the useful part of the result:

```
  pie wall 16.37 s   vLLM wall 16.04 s   difference 320 ms
  boundary idle, 7 clusters                          355 ms
```

There is no third term. Everything else is GPU-bound parity, and pie's own
per-step decode advantage at this width is ~1.1% (§20.13), so **removing the
boundary entirely is worth about 1.01x at conc 512, not more.** The reason
conc 1024 wins comfortably is arithmetic: the same 4096 requests turn over
three times instead of seven, against waves of identical width (§20.18).

## §20.30 — the conc-512 account closes: pie's GPU work is already 2.4% under vLLM's wall

§20.29 said the boundary ran at "7.9 of 13.6 cores, 58% parallel efficiency"
and concluded half the gap was a dependency chain. **That is wrong**, and the
error was in the instrument, not the reasoning: the `cpu_census` only meters
tasks that were wrapped in `CpuMetered`, so every driver thread, scheduler
thread and runtime worker outside those three classes was invisible. Metering
the whole process instead — `/proc/<pid>/task/*/schedstat` summed by thread
class at 200 Hz — says the opposite.

### The boundary is CPU-THROUGHPUT bound, and it is already near the ceiling

```
                        cores busy   runqueue wait
  steady state          3.9 - 4.8        0.00
  cohort boundary      12.1 - 12.5       0.00 - 0.48
```

(`/root/p512/thr_sampler.py PID OUT`, 5 ms period; the analysis is
`/root/p512/parpar.py ERR TXT`.) Read against the container's cgroup
accounting for the same windows (`/root/p512/thr2.py`, analysis
`/root/p512/thran.py`) the picture is unambiguous:

```
  cgroup quota                    13.6 CPUs (cfs_quota 1360000 / period 100000)
  nr_throttled during a whole run 0
  throttled_time during a run     0.000 s
  cgroup cores in a boundary      12.6 - 18.6      (whole container, incl. foreign load)
  cgroup cores in steady state     5.5 -  6.3
```

So: no quota throttling, no OS runqueue wait, and the boundary already burns
three times the steady-state core count. The boundary is not waiting on a
dependency chain and not waiting for a core — **it is executing a fixed lump
of CPU as fast as the runtime's threads can retire it.**

The lump, from the `cpu_census` over the seven boundary windows of one run:

```
  process   2.844 core-s     794 us per turnover   (Process includes Guest)
  guest     1.880 core-s     525 us per turnover
  teardown  0.471 core-s     131 us per turnover
  distinct  3.315 core-s     925 us per turnover
```

474 core-ms per boundary. At the ~12 cores the runtime actually reaches that is
39 ms, and the measured boundaries are 34-53 ms. **There is no headroom to
find; there is only work to remove.**

Largest identified single items, per turnover, from the lifecycle records:

```
  drop(store)   (wasmtime Store, on the Process task)   129 us p50   0.866 core-s / run
  table_drop    (ResourceTable, on the teardown task)    75 us p50   0.537 core-s / run
  permit release / terminate / detach / close_post      ~20 us       0.100 core-s / run
```

### `--worker-threads` is closed for the fourth and final time, with a mechanism

Previous sweeps only ever reported tok/s. Metered, the reason more workers
lose is dramatic and has nothing to do with the boundary:

```
                 tok/s          guest CPU / run   boundary idle
  wt 13 (stock)  31344 / 31847     36.20 core-s      0.360 s
  wt 32          31061 / 31698     79.63 core-s      0.443 s
```

**Identical work costs the guest tasks 2.2x the CPU at 32 workers**, and the
boundary gets *worse*, not better. Whatever the contention is (guest futures
share `ChannelCell`/`fires` mutexes and the scheduler mailbox), adding workers
buys spin, not parallelism. Stock sizing — `available_parallelism()` = 13 — is
correct and this lever should not be re-opened.

### The complete conc-512 wall account

Splitting the wave log by whether a wave carries prefill
(`/root/p512/wsplit2.py`), and the run's wall by the first dispatch and the
last completion (`/root/p512/ht2.py`):

```
  pie wall                    16.31 s
    startup head               0.151 s   spawn -> first dispatch
    GPU busy                  15.70 s     prefill  1.31 s  (24 waves, 118k tok/s)
                                          decode  14.39 s  (504 waves, 35.9k tok/s)
    GPU idle                   0.384 s   7 cohort boundaries, 97.6% busy overall
    tail                       0.076 s   last wave -> last teardown -> harness
  vLLM wall                   16.08 s
```

**pie's GPU work is 15.70 s against vLLM's 16.08 s of wall — pie is already
2.4% ahead on the part that does the inference.** The entire deficit is
0.384 s of boundary idle plus 0.227 s of head and tail. There is no kernel
gap and no scheduling gap to find: prefill runs at 118k tok/s (~142 TFLOPS
bf16 on an L40S, near roofline) and decode at 35.9k tok/s, which is the same
rate vLLM sustains.

That fixes the ceiling arithmetically: **removing every host overhead at
conc 512 yields 16.31 -> 15.70 s = 1.024x, and each individual lever inside it
is worth 0.2-0.6%.** Recovering half of the 0.61 s — which would be a large
amount of work spread over a dozen unrelated micro-optimisations — lands on a
tie, not a win.

### The head, measured for the first time

```
  4096 process_spawned         -151.0 .. -16.6 ms  (bench submits the whole run up front)
  first 512 process_admitted   -130.5 ..  -1.0 ms
  first wave dispatch                       0.0 ms   (460 fires, prefill)
  instantiations STARTED in the head    1053
  instantiations FINISHED in the head   1024        <- two cohorts, not one
```

The prewarm conveyor is instantiating the *second* cohort inside the window in
which the *first* cohort is still trying to reach its first dispatch, on the
same 13 cores. That is the one structural finding in the head, and it is worth
at most ~0.25% (vLLM's intercept is 73 ms against pie's ~151 ms).

### Standing, on the pushed build, interleaved, one process at a time

```
  conc 1024 @ 16384   pie 32472 32404 32448   vLLM 31458 31102 31439   = 1.035   WON
  conc  512 @  8192   pie 31447 31832 31548   vLLM 32622 32626 32583   = 0.969
```

conc 512 varies 2.6% run to run while vLLM varies 0.13%, and the variance is
this box: pie's boundary demands ~12 cores against a 13.6-core quota shared
with other tenants, so pie loses whatever the neighbours take and vLLM (which
is GPU-bound and never exceeds ~3 cores) does not. On a quiet box pie measures
0.98-0.99 at conc 512.

### Conclusion for conc 512

The gap is understood completely and is not a defect. pie spends 3.7% of its
wall on per-request programmability — bringing a WASM guest up and tearing it
down — and buys back 2.4% in inference efficiency. At conc 1024 the same
4096 requests turn over three times instead of seven and pie wins by 3.5-4.6%.
At conc 512 the turnover count doubles and the account inverts. **The benchmark
makes every request identical, so every boundary is fleet-wide; the deficit is
a property of that shape, not of the engine's steady state, and any workload
with varied request lengths never forms the boundary at all.**

## §20.31 — a 1.6% measurement artifact, two refuted levers, and the guest CPU decomposed

This section corrects §20.24's noise-floor claim, closes two more levers, lands
one provably-exact reduction that measures neutral, and — for the first time —
says where the guest's per-fire CPU actually goes.

### ★ THE A/B PROTOCOL WAS WRONG (this corrects §20.24)

§20.24 recorded a 0.3% noise floor after mimalloc landed. That number is real
but it only describes **back-to-back identical runs**:

```
  9 identical runs, consecutive:  32145 32103 32156 32030 32054 32139 31937 32116 32036
                                  mean 32079, sd 0.21%, spread 0.68%
```

Arm *means* drift much further than that. `PIE_TURNAROUND_WAVES=4` is a
**provable no-op** at the default frame size — `frames_in_flight()` is
`1 + turnaround_waves().div_ceil(k)`, and at k=2 both 3 and 4 give F=3, W=7 —
yet in four fixed-order rounds it beat its own baseline **4 times out of 4 by
1.59%**:

```
  base 31547 31528 31400 31922   mean 31599
  R=4  32120 32009 32200 32075   mean 32101   +1.59%, 4/4
  R=5  31931 32094 31398 32006   mean 31857
```

All twelve runs have identical wave structure (528 batches, batch-size
histogram `[0,0,0,0,0,0,2,526]`, 1024-row waves, GPU pinned at 2520 MHz), so
nothing in the engine changed. Reversing the order settles it: run R=4 first
and base second and they measure **31987 vs 31985 — identical**.

The box is shared; a ~20-minute window drifts by up to 1.6%.

```
  RULES, from now on
    (a) every sweep carries a null control (a change that provably does nothing)
    (b) alternate arm order (ABBA), never fixed-order rounds
    (c) treat anything under 2% as unresolvable by tok/s alone — read
        `cpu_census` core-seconds instead, which are far more stable
```

Two of this session's earlier readings were this artifact and nothing else.

### ★ LEVER CLOSED: wasmtime pooling warm slots

The pooling allocator keeps `max_unused_warm_slots` (default 100) instantiated
stores per module for reuse. The bench runs 512 concurrent processes against
`wasm_max_instances = 16384`, so the hypothesis was that 100 warm slots starve
the boundary. Added `PIE_BENCH_WARM_SLOTS` / `PIE_BENCH_WARM_MB` overrides and
A/B'd three interleaved pairs at conc 512:

```
  warm 100    31863 32055 31490   mean 31803
  warm 16384  31940 31607 31930   mean 31826   +0.07%
  store_drop_us p50 139/135 -> 125/140 (unchanged)
```

**No lever.** With one component every pooled slot is already module-affine, so
the warm-slot list buys nothing that the pool does not already give.

### ★ LEVER CLOSED: run-ahead window R and frame size, re-checked post-mimalloc

`PIE_TURNAROUND_WAVES=4` is a no-op by construction (above). `R=5` (W 7 -> 9) is
inside the noise once the drift is accounted for. `PIE_FRAME_SIZE` 1 and 3 at
conc 512 measure 30852/31887 and 31541 against a base band of 31600-32100 — no
signal in either direction.

### ★ THE BOUNDARY IS THE GUESTS' SUBMIT PATH

Re-measured on today's build (conc 512, 4096x128, 8192 pages):

```
  span 16.09 s | GPU busy 15.69 s (97.5%) | GPU idle 0.403 s over 7 boundaries
  prefill  24 waves  1.329 s  116k tok/s
  decode  504 waves 14.362 s   35.9k tok/s (1024-row waves)

  per turnover: guest 616 us | process 900 us (INCLUDES guest) | teardown 118 us
  whole run:    guest 35.4 core-s | process 40.3 | teardown 0.54
```

`35.4 core-s / 524288 fires = 67 us per fire`, which is exactly §20.15's
post-fix submit cost. At a boundary each successor issues one prefill plus its
run-ahead window (7 fires) ~= 470 us, which *is* the measured 616 us guest term.
Boundary idle is that CPU divided by the ~12 cores §20.30 measured.

### ★ WHERE THE 67 us ACTUALLY GOES (new instrumentation)

`PHASE_NAMES` / `phase_add` in `scheduler.rs` meter the guest submit path and
emit one `submit_phase` record per phase in the `cpu_census` dump, gated on
`fire_timing_enabled()` like every other counter. Conc 512, whole run:

```
  phase              us/fire   core-s    share of submit
  hp_bind_geometry      1.56     0.82        13.7%
  hp_declare            1.86     0.98        16.3%
  hp_grant              1.37     0.72        12.0%
  hp_launch             5.64     2.96        49.5%
  submit_total         11.39     5.97       100.0%
  HostShadow::advance  11.18     5.86    (after submit, not inside it)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  guest CPU census                35.41
```

**Submit is 11.4 us and `advance` is another 11.2 us — together 33% of the
guest's per-fire CPU. The other 45 us per fire (23.6 core-s, 67%) is outside
both**: the WASM guest body, the WIT crossings, the channel puts and takes, and
`drain_settled` / `wire_channels_to_pipeline` ahead of the metered region. That
is the largest unattacked term in the whole boundary and it has never been
measured before.

Inside submit, `hp_launch` is half the cost. That is **not** the
`kv_translation` clone it looks like: the translation carries one entry per
working-set page and a lane holds ~16 of them at conc 512, so the `to_vec()` is
64 bytes. `hp_launch` is the scheduler submit itself — building the ticket
reservation and moving a 1280-byte `LaunchPlan` onto the loop's queue.

**TRAP THAT COST AN HOUR.** `fire.rs` has **two** production `advance` call
sites, not one: `:1194` on the host-geometry path and `:2332` on the
device-geometry path. This benchmark takes the **host** path exclusively;
`devgeo_total` counts **zero** calls over a whole run. Instrumentation placed on
`fire_device_geometry` reads zero and looks like a broken counter.

### ★ SHADOW FOLD DEMOTION: provably exact, throughput neutral

`HostShadow::advance` folds the trace's channel-writing stages once per fire.
§20.15 already dropped every `ChanPut`-free stage as a provable no-op. This
section adds the second exact reduction and moves the whole decision off the
per-instance shadow.

`pie_eval::pareval::geometry_taint` computes `device_decided`, a whole-trace
taint fixpoint: a value is tainted iff its backward slice contains a
`KernelCall`, an `IntrinsicVal`, an `Rng`, or a device-decided channel — all of
which `fold_stage` blocks **unconditionally**. So a statically tainted put is
`Err` on *every* fire, and a stage whose every put is tainted can commit those
channels unknown directly: that is the same commit the fold would make, and it
is exactly what the existing fault path already does. Cross-stage reads are
unaffected (`pending.get(chan) == Some(Err(_))` makes `known` return `None`
either way) and `advance` discards the blocker kind (`slot.ok()`), so
`UnknownChannel` versus `Kernel` is unobservable.

**The demotion must not be applied to `eval_descriptor_ports`, which does
surface blocker kinds per port.**

Landed as `ShadowPlan`: `taken_per_pass` plus a `Vec<Phase>` where
`Phase::Fold(stage)` still folds and `Phase::Unknown(chans)` commits unknown.
The plan is derived once per program and cached on `RegisteredProgram` behind a
`OnceLock`, so 512 instances share one derivation instead of each rebuilding
the filter. `geometry_taint` moved to the same cache — `forward.rs:695` was
recomputing the whole-trace fixpoint on every `ForwardPass`.

`PIE_SHADOW_FOLD=full` restores the old behaviour for a one-build A/B:

```
                        folds/call   ns/call   tok/s
  PIE_SHADOW_FOLD=full     1.0000     11576    32203
  default (demoted)        0.9922     11656    31818
```

On this trace only the **prefill** program's put is statically device-decided,
so the demotion removes 4096 folds of 524288 — 0.8%, and the cost is identical.
**Kept anyway**: it is strictly less work, it is provably exact, the per-program
caching removes a real per-instance derivation, and on traces whose decode
epilogue is sampler-fed it removes the last whole-trace evaluation entirely.

### ★ STANDING (final, ABBA-interleaved, one process at a time)

```
  conc 1024 @16384   pie 32843 32603 32518   vLLM 31001 31187 31194   = 1.049  WON
  conc  512 @ 8192   pie 31537 31595 31633   vLLM 32752 32696 32740   = 0.965
  conc  512 @ 8192   pie 32334 31444 32205   vLLM 32697 32677 32648   = 0.979 (earlier)
```

The two conc-512 rows are the same build class measured hours apart. vLLM reads
**within 0.2%** across both (32648-32752) while pie moves 1.3%, and
`/proc/loadavg` was 14.1 against this container's 13.6-CPU quota during the
second. That is the §20.30 sensitivity, directly observed: pie's boundary wants
~12 of 13.6 cores and the box is shared, so pie alone degrades when a co-tenant
runs. vLLM is a usable control for exactly this reason, and CPU census
core-seconds are the reading to trust — the instrumentation added in this
section cost **nothing** (guest 37.36 -> 36.59 core-s across the two builds).

conc 512 remains bounded by the arithmetic of §20.30: pie's GPU work (15.69 s)
is already 2.4% under vLLM's entire wall (16.06 s), so the ceiling is 1.024x and
the whole remaining deficit is 0.403 s of cohort-boundary idle plus 0.227 s of
head and tail. Every individual lever inside that 3.9% is worth 0.2-0.6%, and
the ranked list of what is left is now, for the first time, measured:

```
  1. the 41 us/fire still outside every meter   21.4 core-s   see below
  2. HostShadow::advance                         5.9 core-s   backward-slice the fold
  3. hp_launch (the scheduler submit)            2.9 core-s

### ★ THE 45 us: TWO CANDIDATES METERED, BOTH SMALL

The two named suspects were the settlement drain ahead of the metered submit
region and the receive path (`take`). Both were instrumented and both are
small. Phases 1 and 7-10 are new here; `rx_*` wraps `materialize_channel`.

```
  phase          calls      per call     total     what it is
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  hp_preamble    524288      1.60 us     0.84 s    drain_settled + wire_channels
  rx_poll       2096860      0.61 us     1.28 s    poll_channel, 4x per take
  rx_finalize    524288      8.42 ms       wall    finalize_op_await (the wait)
  rx_wall        524288     15.56 ms       wall    whole take, incl. the wait
  rx_wait        261998     14.28 ms       wall    await_channel_progress
```

`drain_settled` is **not** the hidden cost: 1.6 us per fire. Neither is the
receive path: its whole synchronous CPU is `rx_poll`, 1.28 core-s.

Two things worth keeping from those numbers. `rx_poll` runs **4 times per
take** — the loop re-polls after the finalize gate and again after each wake,
and each poll re-resolves the channel resource. And `rx_wait` fires on only
**half** the takes (261,998 of 524,288): the other half find the value already
published, which is the run-ahead window doing exactly its job.

Running total, conc 512, whole run:

```
  submit_total          5.97 core-s
  hp_preamble           0.84
  HostShadow::advance   5.91
  rx_poll               1.28
  -----------------------------
  accounted            14.00
  guest CPU census     35.41       -> 21.4 core-s (41 us/fire) still unmetered
```

### ★ LANDED: the fold allocated every value twice

`fold_stage` carried two parallel tracks indexed by SSA value id: `slots:
Vec<Result<Value, EvalBlocker>>` for known/unknown, and `dense: Vec<Value>`
for `eval_op`, which needs a flat `&[Value]`. `dense` was built by **cloning**
each `slots` entry, so every host-folded value allocated twice on a path that
runs once per fire per channel-writing stage.

The two tracks carry independent information and do not need to be built from
each other: `blocked_at: Vec<Option<EvalBlocker>>` holds the first blocker on a
value's derivation chain and `dense` holds the value, each pushed once by move.
The only clone left is at `ChanPut`, which is the fold's sole output, and there
are a handful of those per stage against tens of ops. Same results, strictly
fewer allocations.

```
  HostShadow::advance   11.27 -> 9.56 us/fire      5.91 -> 5.01 core-s   -15.1%
  guest CPU census      36.59 -> 35.67 core-s
```

Both readings are CPU, not wall, which is what makes this measurable at all
while the box is contended (`/proc/loadavg` 15.9-23.2 against a 13.6-CPU
quota). The wall effect is about 0.1% and is not resolvable here.

**A refinement that did NOT pay.** Refcounting the blocker track
(`Vec<Option<Rc<EvalBlocker>>>`) to stop `EvalBlocker::Kernel`'s `String` from
re-allocating at every step of a blocked chain measured **neutral to slightly
worse** — advance 5.014 -> 5.080 core-s, guest CPU 35.67 -> 35.61. The folded
stages on this trace are the geometry prologue, where most ops are *not*
blocked, so the propagation clone barely runs. Reverted: an `Rc` indirection
with no evidence behind it is not the more correct code.

What is left is the WASM body itself plus wasmtime's async machinery: every
host call that awaits costs a fiber switch out of and back into the guest
stack, and the steady loop makes a `take`, a `submit` and a `reserve` per
frame. Splitting that further needs `Store::call_hook`, which meters the
wasm/host boundary directly — not yet done.

**Why this matters for the wall clock, precisely.** Steady state uses 3.9-4.8
of the 13.6-core quota, so per-fire CPU is free there; the GPU is 97.5% busy
and there is nothing to convert saved CPU into. It matters only at the cohort
boundary, which §20.30 measured as CPU-throughput bound at 12.1-12.5 cores.
A successor fills a `window_fires = 6` run-ahead window on admission, so
~6 fires x 67 us = 400 us of the 525 us of guest CPU per turnover is per-fire
cost. Halving per-fire guest CPU would take the boundary's 474 core-ms to
~370 and its 39 ms floor to ~30 ms — about **0.4% of wall** across seven
boundaries. That is the honest ceiling on this whole line of work, and it is
why it is documented rather than pursued further.

## §20.32 — collapsing the experiment scaffolding

Every change in §20.24-§20.31 was landed behind an env kill switch so an A/B
could be run against the shipped binary without a rebuild. All of them are
settled now, so the scaffolding comes out: a default-ON gate whose `else`
branch is never taken in production is a second, untested code path that
nothing measures and nothing tests.

**Gates removed** (each was `!env_off(KEY)`, i.e. ON unless explicitly
disabled), with the measurement that settled it:

| knob | what the OFF branch did | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `PIE_PREWARM_HOLD` | release the prewarm slot in FRONT of the bind park, and cap the conveyor at 64 | §20.27: holding through bind is what makes the conveyor one cohort wide |
| `PIE_BIND_STAGE_LAZY` | open the whole 2n bind pool at t=0 instead of after the first cohort seats | §20.28: cohort 0's bind -> admit step is 155 ms p50 against 1536 concurrent prologues |
| `PIE_BIND_DEFER` | release departing bind permits during a boundary join | §20.26: 512 `process_bind_admitted` land inside the window the boundary needs |
| `PIE_SHADOW_FOLD=full` | fold every channel-writing stage, pre-demotion | §20.29: the demotion is proved exact by `stage_put_taint` |

`MAX_PREWARM_PROCESSES` was renamed `UNCAPPED_PREWARM_PROCESSES`: with an
execution cap the conveyor is sized to one cohort and never consults it, so
the old name described a bound it no longer imposes.

**The phase counters are typed.** They were a 12-slot array indexed by bare
integers at the call sites (`phase_add(4, hp)`), with the names in a different
file — including one `"unused"` slot that four distinct regions of
`fire_device_geometry` all summed into, which is worse than no measurement.
Now `CpuPhase` and `WaitPhase` are `#[repr(usize)]`-style enums with their
names alongside, the four bogus marks are gone, and the whole-device-geometry
meter is kept.

**CPU and wall meters are no longer in the same table.** `submit_total` and
the `submit_*` phases contain no `.await`, so their elapsed wall IS CPU and
they are summable with the census. `chan_take` and `chan_await_progress` span
parks and are mostly the task *not running*. Both used to be emitted as
`"event":"submit_phase"`, which invites adding them. They are now
`submit_phase` (CPU) and `submit_wait` (wall), and `rx_finalize` — which
overlapped `chan_take` entirely — is dropped.

**The census reports its own truncation.** `CPU_CENSUS` is
8192 x 10 ms = 81.9 s and silently dropped everything past that; the
contention `soak` scenario runs 124 s and was already losing samples. Late CPU
now accumulates into `CPU_CENSUS_DROPPED_NS` and every `cpu_census` record
carries `window_us` and `dropped_us`, so a truncated census can no longer be
read as a complete one.

## §20.33 — the conc-512 gap is GPU work rate, not host scheduling

§20.30 closed the conc-512 account on an assumption that turned out to be
wrong: that vLLM's GPU-busy time is approximately its wall time. Measured
directly (`nvidia-smi utilization.gpu` at 21 ms, window aligned to the exact
benchmark duration, ABBA, identical 524288 output tokens):

| run | wall | GPU-busy | util | GPU idle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pie | 16.66 s | 15.60 s | 93.6% | 6.4% |
| pie | 17.00 s | 15.91 s | 93.6% | 6.4% |
| vLLM | 16.32 s | **14.61 s** | 89.5% | **10.5%** |

**pie keeps the GPU busier than vLLM and still loses.** The deficit is the GPU
work itself. pie's own wave timing splits its 16.65 s span into 1032 decode
waves = 14.49 s (median 14.20 ms, 512 tokens each) and 23 prefill waves =
2.16 s. pie's decode alone is within 1% of vLLM's *entire* GPU-busy time, so
the decode kernels are competitive and the whole gap sits in pie's separate
prefill plus the turnover around it.

### pie DOES support mixed prefill+decode in one forward pass

A prior claim in this log — "pie has no chunked prefill" — was wrong as a
capability statement, and the correction matters because it changes which
levers are even available.

- `driver/cuda/src/batch/frame.cpp:1173-1177` **derives** `is_pure_decode` per
  step from `qo_indptr`: true iff every request contributes exactly one token.
  Models then compute `use_decode_path = is_pure_decode && !force_prefill_path`,
  so a step of 511 x Nr=1 plus 1 x Nr=37 simply runs the general ragged-prefill
  kernel. Kernels read `Nr = qo_indptr[r+1] - qo_indptr[r]` per request, i.e. a
  varlen layout — nothing assumes uniform token counts.
- `runtime/engine/src/scheduler/worker.rs:383-437` `LaunchGrouping::accepts`
  rejects only on: same instance, same pipeline (ordering rule B3), solo
  submission, mask/device-geometry incompatibility, then capacity
  (`max_forward_requests` / `max_forward_tokens` / `max_page_refs`).
  **Per-request token count is never a grouping criterion.**

### The cohort is emergent, not a pie concept

There is no cohort object anywhere in the engine. The 24 pure-prefill waves are
a workload-plus-admission artifact with two independent causes:

1. **Lockstep from the workload shape.** All 4096 requests carry the same
   ~37-token prompt and exactly 128 output tokens, so an admitted batch of 512
   finishes in the same wave and frees all 512 execution seats at once. Each
   such group = 3 prefill waves (221+221+70 requests, ~8177/8177/2590 tokens,
   capped by `max_forward_tokens=8192`) + 129 decode waves. 8 x 3 = 24 prefill
   and 8 x 129 = 1032 decode — exactly the observed counts. During the decode
   phase no prefilling request exists, so there is nothing to mix.
2. **The request cap equals the concurrency.** The planner derives
   `decode_target=512` -> `max_forward_requests=512`, so a conc-512 decode wave
   is exactly full and could not admit a prefill even if one were pending.

### Boundary packing: both exits refuted

Forcing the prefill budget in both directions (`PIE_CUDA_PREFILL_TOKENS`):

| pft | waves | prefill waves | boundary shape | idle | busy | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1024 | — | — | — | **305 ms** | **16.74 s** | 30274 |
| 2048 | — | — | — | 1127 ms | 16.51 s | 29367 |
| 4096 | — | — | — | 762 ms | 16.35 s | 30208 |
| **8192** | 1056 | 24 | P221 D221 P221 D221 P70 D70 | 496 ms | **15.85 s** | **30541** |
| 16384 | 1040 | 16 | P442 D442 P70 D70 | — | — | 29842 |
| 32768 | 1024 | 8 | P512 D512 D512 | — | — | 29813 |

- **Upward is slower.** pft=32768 produces exactly the "ideal" schedule — one
  prefill wave per group, zero partial decode waves — and loses 2.7%. It
  removes 110 ms of partial waves and adds ~250 ms of prefill plus ~100 ms of
  decode (N=32768 costs 1153 MiB of persistent inputs vs 289 MiB).
- **Downward is slower too.** pft=1024 does exactly what the idle theory
  predicts (idle -38%, util 98.2%) and still loses, because busy grows 0.89 s.
  **Buying one unit of idle costs ~4.7 units of GPU work.**
- **A 3x cost-model error is corrected.** A decode wave does not cost ~14.35 ms
  regardless of width: the 24 partial waves total 0.11 s, i.e. ~4.6 ms each.
  Decode is **linear** in batch width here (14.37 ms / 512 = 28.1 us per
  request; partial waves average 26.9 us). So boundary packing was only ever
  worth 110 ms = 0.66%, not the 344 ms projected. pie's 512-wide decode step is
  not launch-overhead-bound.
- **Capacity never blocked mixing.** Mixed waves = 0 at every rung. At
  pft=16384 the boundary is P442 **D442** P70 D70: while 442 decode, the last
  70 prefills need 2590 tokens against 15942 free. The chunk structure is
  self-perpetuating instead — a group that prefills in chunks of (221,221,70)
  also *retires* in those chunks, so its successors are admitted in those
  chunks. Remove the chunking (pft=32768) and the partial waves vanish
  entirely, confirming the cycle. **There is no missed mixing opportunity in
  this workload.**

### The boundary bubble, fully characterized

`idle2.py` computes GPU idle as the complement of the union of every wave's
`[driver_started_us, native_complete_us]`. Span 16.35 s, busy 15.85 s, idle
**0.496 s**, util 97.0% — and all of it is **7 discrete gaps** (6 x ~42 ms plus
one outlier). Zero sub-15 ms micro-bubbles: inter-wave turnaround is fully
hidden by the frame pipeline. 7 = 4096/512 - 1 is exactly the group-boundary
count, and every gap is followed by a prefill wave.

Phase split of a typical 42 ms bubble: ~5 ms idle -> first fire, **~27 ms
arrival spread**, ~10 ms last-fire -> driver launch. And the cause is not guest
latency: at every one of the 7 boundaries all 512 successors had *already*
entered `guest_main` and been bind-admitted before the GPU went idle, with
`sub_min - adm_min = 0.1 ms`. Prewarm and the double-buffered bind pool work
perfectly. What is spread is the **execution admission** — the retiring group's
512 `ProcessCtx::drop`s release their seats over ~32 ms, host-CPU bound.

Host CPU at 10 ms resolution against the 13.6-core cgroup quota:

| | in-bubble | out-of-bubble |
|---|---|---|
| total | **10.27 cores** | 5.41 mean / 3.25 p50 |
| teardown | **1.30** | **0.01** |

Decode leaves ~10 cores idle; the boundary needs them but the work does not
exist yet. Teardown is 100% boundary-concentrated, and splitting it shows the
filesystem was a red herring: **94% is the wasmtime `ResourceTable` drop**
(155.7 us mean, 0.638 core-s total) against 0.1 us for scratch removal.
Removing teardown entirely would free ~1.3 of the 10.27 in-bubble cores =>
~4 ms/boundary => **0.17% of wall**. Not worth surgery.

`ctx.rs`/`teardown.rs` did land one correctness fix found here: `scratch_dir`
is now `Option<PathBuf>`, `Some` only when the sandbox actually created it.
With `allow_fs` false `base_dir` is empty, so teardown was calling
`remove_dir_all` on a **relative** `./<pid>` under the server's CWD. Measured
neutral; kept because it is correct.

### Global host configuration is exhausted

Swept every process-wide knob looking for a second mimalloc-class win.

- **Build profile** was the only real gap: the wheel ships with the default
  `release` profile (`lto = false`, `codegen-units = 16`), so the perf-critical
  pyo3 cdylib had cross-crate inlining off. Adding `lto = "thin"` doubled build
  time (8 min -> 14m42s) for **+0.3%** on throughput and -1.0% of host CPU,
  both under this box's ~2% resolution. **Reverted.**
- **wasmtime** (`bootstrap.rs:608-636`): every perf-relevant default is already
  the fast one — Cranelift `Speed`, `memory_init_cow`, SIMD on, fuel and epoch
  interruption off, pooling allocator with all five `total_*` caps set.
- **tokio** (`worker/src/engine.rs:339-345`): only `worker_threads` is set, and
  **the scheduler loop is not on tokio at all** — it is a dedicated OS thread
  parking on a crossbeam `recv_timeout` (`worker.rs:2550-2553`), so
  `event_interval` / `global_queue_interval` / `disable_lifo_slot` cannot touch
  the hot path.
- **mimalloc env knobs** are inapplicable here: `HugePages_Total = 0` and THP
  is in `madvise` mode.
- **CUDA sync policy** is a non-issue: settlement is a `cudaLaunchHostFunc`
  callback (`context.cpp:542`), not a host spin-wait.
- **CUDA arch** is correctly detected (L40S, cc 8.9, 142 SM); 89 is not in
  `PIE_CUDA_ACCELERATED_ARCHS`, so the missing-`a`-suffix trap does not apply.
- **Attention backend** is FlashInfer v0.6.15, the same family vLLM uses.

The structural reason the ceiling is low: pie is 93.6% GPU-busy, so only
1.06 s of the 16.66 s wall is host-side idle and every process-wide host lever
is capped at ~0.2-0.5% of wall. The mimalloc win landed when the host side had
far more slack; that regime is gone.

### What the clock/power trace says instead

Sampling `clocks.sm,power.draw,utilization.gpu,utilization.memory` at 100 ms
through a full conc-512 run of each engine (busy = `gpu_util >= 50`):

| | sm MHz | power W (mean/p50) | gpu_util (mean/p10) | tok/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pie | 2378 | **298.4 / 309.6** | 95.8 / **78** | 30906 |
| vLLM | 2350 | **320.1 / 335.3** | 97.8 / **99** | 32633 |

Neither engine is clock- or power-capped, so **vLLM extracts a higher work rate
from the same silicon** (+7.3% power at the same clocks), and pie's util p10 of
78% vs vLLM's 99% is the boundary bubble made visible in a second, independent
trace.

### The honest ranking

1. **pie does ~1.2 s (8.5%) more GPU work than vLLM** — busy 15.85 s vs 14.61 s.
   This is the decode step itself and it is *bigger* than the bubble.
2. **Boundary bubble 496 ms (3.0% of span)** — fully characterized, both
   wave-shape exits refuted, remaining host-CPU levers each worth <=0.3%.

Closing the entire bubble would give ~+3.1% and still leave pie ~1.6% under
vLLM. **The bubble is necessary but not sufficient; the decode step is where
the rest lives.**

## §20.34 — the driver measures its own prefill budget

Every number in §20.33 was measured against `max_forward_tokens = 8192`. That
value is not a scorer output. It is a hand-tuned constant fingerprinted to
exactly this model and GPU, and it turns out to be **the wrong one**.

### Where N=8192 came from

`driver/cuda/src/store/memory_planner.cpp` selects a plan through three tiers:

1. **profile cache** — reads `~/.cache/pie/cuda_memory_profiles.json` and pins
   whatever it finds. **Dead machinery: nothing in the repo ever wrote that
   file.** The only references were the path helper and this reader, so
   `selector=profiled` could never fire without someone hand-authoring JSON.
2. **model fingerprints** — four predicates carrying magic numbers
   8192 / 12288 / 5632, each gated on `forced_prefill == 0`.
3. generic max-score.

Our benchmark reported `selector=rule N=8192`, and every clause of
`prefer_qwen3_small_ada_prefill_shape` held (auto profile, tp=1, sm_89,
SM=142>=100, `model_type=="qwen3"`, `hidden_size==1024` = Qwen3-0.6B). Tier 1
could not fire, so tier 2 did.

This also revealed a **confound in the pft ladder of §20.33**: forcing
`PIE_CUDA_PREFILL_TOKENS` disables every `prefer_*` predicate, so the ladder's
rungs resolved to `latency` while the baseline resolved to `balanced`. Checked
after the fact — every rung logged identical `page_size=16 R=512
page_refs=262144 logical_kv_pages=22038`, and the env var has exactly one
reader — so the ladder *was* a valid single-variable sweep. But every rung was
a **single sample** on a box that resolves ~2%, which matters below.

### A candidate dump, and a fingerprint that was pure dead weight

Added `PIE_CUDA_PLANNER_DUMP=K` — prints the top K scored candidates with
`arena`/`kv_tokens`, marks the selected one, and says explicitly when an
override moved the selection off rank 1. It showed the selected candidate **was
already the scorer's rank-1**, and reading the scorer confirms
`prefer_qwen3_small_ada_prefill_shape` feeds no score term at all — only the
override branch. Deleting it produced a **byte-identical plan**
(`N=8192 R=512 page=16 persistent=289 MiB logical_kv_pages=22038`). It was
dead weight, and it was pinning the worse value.

The dump also exposed a fragility worth recording: the top four candidates are
**exact ties** at score 18.6689 (balanced and throughput produce identical
plans), so `std::max_element` picks by iteration order.

### Tier 1 made real: a measurement-based calibrator

`store/planner_profile_cache.{hpp,cpp}` now owns the key schema, the lookup and
an **atomic writer** (temp file + rename, replaces-or-appends by key, never
throws on a corrupt cache). `memory_planner.cpp` drops its inline reader in
favour of the shared one, and the cache-match loop now picks the
**highest-scoring** match instead of the first.

`batch/planner_calibration.{hpp,cpp}` runs the measurement, hooked into
`context.cpp` right after `capture_forward_graph_lattice` — which already ran
synthetic forwards post-init and is the working template (`invoke_prepare` +
`invoke_body` + persistent-input fills, synthetic KV aliasing page 0). The hook
**must sit before `attention_allocator_->trim_bytes(0)`**; placing it after
released the arena and crashed FlashInfer with `invalid argument`.

Design constraints, deliberately conservative:

- **Opt-in** via `PIE_CUDA_PLANNER_CALIBRATE=1`. A process that never
  calibrates behaves exactly as before. The sweep costs ~10-30 s of startup.
- **Refuses** when `tp_size > 1` (ranks would desync on collectives) or when
  `rs_cache != nullptr` (recurrent state is not idempotent).
- Pins **only `max_forward_tokens`**. `policy_profile`, `kv_page_size` and
  `max_forward_requests` stay wildcards, so the scorer still decides everything
  that was never measured.
- Measures with `emit_logits=true` and `num_logit_rows = R` so the LM head is
  included; omitting it is a fixed per-step cost that biases toward smaller N.
- Selection is **maximin over prompt lengths** — normalise each budget's rate
  by the best rate at that same L, score by the worst normalised rate — with
  the tolerance taken from the **measured stddev**, not a tuned constant.

**Two design errors caught during development**, both worth stating because
they are easy to repeat:

- A 1-D sweep that couples `L = N/R` is invalid: growing the budget grows the
  prompt length, and attention's O(L^2) term masquerades as a budget effect.
  The sweep is 2-D — prompt length held fixed while the budget varies.
- The first selection wrote `max_forward_requests` into the cache. R varied as
  a *consequence* of (N, L) and was never the subject of measurement. Writing
  it would have pinned an unmeasured field.

### The surface, and the result

tok/s by (prompt length L x budget N), Qwen3-0.6B / L40S, R=512, page 16,
stddev ~0.1%:

| L | 512 | 1024 | 2048 | 4096 | 8192 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 111019 | 109258 | 109407 | 109457 | 109568 |
| 4 | 103152 | 121366 | 132620 | 132597 | 132759 |
| 16 | 109750 | 131158 | 141787 | **151867** | 138958 |
| 64 | 109513 | 134094 | 144837 | **154195** | 141567 |
| 256 | 97260 | 116066 | 142453 | **152562** | 139492 |

The knee is at **N=4096 for every L**, and N=8192 is ~9% worse everywhere. That
the knee does not move with L is the result that makes it cacheable at all: it
is a property of the device and the model, not of the workload. (The L=1 and
L=4 rows plateau because token count saturates at `R*L`.)

End-to-end, conc-512, ABBA over four pairs (A = calibrated cache present,
B = cache absent):

| | tok/s | mean |
|---|---|---|
| calibrated N=4096 (`selector=profiled`) | 31702 / 32013 / 31919 / 31589 | **31806** |
| scored N=8192 (`selector=rule`) | 30638 / 31397 / 31844 / 31219 | **31274** |

**+1.7%, all four pairwise deltas positive**, with A running at the *higher*
average loadavg (17.3 vs 16.1). It also frees 1414 MiB of arena
(3212 -> 1798 MiB) and drops persistent inputs from 289 to 145 MiB.

Repeated independently after a rebase onto a later `dev`, four fresh pairs:

| | tok/s | mean |
|---|---|---|
| calibrated N=4096 | 32387 / 31642 / 32268 / 32086 | **32096** |
| scored N=8192 | 31554 / 31523 / 32021 / 31477 | **31644** |

**+1.43%, again all four pairwise deltas positive** (+2.64 / +0.38 / +0.77 /
+1.93%), and again with A at the higher mean loadavg (16.8 vs 13.8). Across
both campaigns that is **8 of 8 pairs in the same direction**.

A single A-vs-B pair taken during that verification read the *opposite* sign
(31749 vs 32064) — which is exactly the failure mode retracted below, observed
live. One tok/s sample is not evidence on this box.

### ⚠ RETRACTION

§20.33's conclusion — "**8192 is a local optimum in both directions — do not
retry wave-shape levers**" — **is refuted.** The ladder was not confounded, it
was **under-powered**: one sample per rung on a box that resolves ~2%. A
repeated ABBA at the same two points reverses the sign. Single-sample ladders
are not evidence here, and this log should not have drawn a directional
conclusion from one.

### What is still hardcoded

Three fingerprints remain (`prefer_qwen3_8b_prefill_shape` 12288,
`prefer_qwen3_8b_tp2_ada_shape` 5632,
`prefer_nemotron_h_tp2_ada_prefill_shape`), plus a `prefill_candidate_cap`
ternary (`prop.major >= 12 ? 16384 : 8192`) and a qwen3_5_moe score hack. The
calibrator is now the mechanism that can retire them — but all three cover
configurations (Qwen3-8B TP1, Qwen3-8B TP2, Nemotron-H TP2) that cannot be
validated on a single L40S, so they stay until someone can measure them.

## §20.35 — PTIR is already at the bandwidth roof; the fence tax was next door

The remaining gap at conc-512 was **-1.56%** (pie 32052 vs vLLM 32562, ABBA
3+3, calibrated `N=4096`). The question was whether pie's *programmability*
machinery — running user programs on the device — is what pays for it, and
whether any of it can be shaved without giving programmability up.

### Decomposing pie's GPU time

`nsys profile --trace=cuda --cuda-graph-trace=node`, 1024 requests at
concurrency 512. **The `--cuda-graph-trace=node` flag is mandatory**: without
it, graphs hide ~90% of kernels and the profile is actively misleading. nsys
inflates wall time ~1.7x under node tracing, so only WITHIN-trace ratios are
usable.

| category | ms | % | instances |
|---|---|---|---|
| GEMM | 3316.1 | 52.8 | 64950 |
| attention (`BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCache`) | 2585.2 | 41.2 | 7672 |
| model elementwise / norm / rope / kv | 233.7 | 3.7 | 32560 |
| **guest PTIR program** (`ptir_fused_*`) | **78.8** | **1.3** | 276 |
| **host-channel pipeline** | **62.4** | **1.0** | 1644 |

Two things fell out of this that contradict earlier assumptions in this log:

- **~41% of the decode step is paged attention**, not GEMM. Decode is not
  launch-bound and not GEMM-bound in the way §20.x assumed.
- **pie-only machinery was 2.25% of GPU time — LARGER than the 1.56% gap.**
  So it was, for once, a lever that could actually cover the deficit.

### The PTIR kernel is NOT a pie tax — it is at the hardware roof

`ptir_fused_8cdf1d4e51797f1c_r0` runs `grid=(512,1,1) blk=(1024,1,1)` —
one block per request — at `REG:55 STACK:96 SHARED:516`, 308 us traced
(~181 us real). Its job is argmax over the logits: 512 x 151936 bf16 =
**155.6 MB**, which at 181 us is **~860 GB/s, essentially L40S peak**.

**It is bandwidth-saturated and vLLM must read exactly the same logits to
sample.** There is nothing to shave, and this corrects the earlier claim that
the guest program was the top lead. Programmability is not costing anything
here: the guest program is doing work every engine has to do.

(Aside: PTIR regions are compiled at runtime by NVRTC with `--fmad=false
--prec-div=true --prec-sqrt=true`. Relaxing those is a real lever but it
changes numerics, so it was not pursued.)

### THE FINDING — a system release fence per host-channel word

Profiling the pie-specific kernels instead turned up an anomaly:
`k_settle_host_channels_batch` cost **133.3 us/step** — 4x
`k_scatter_host_publish_copies` at the *same* geometry (512 blocks x 128
threads) despite doing strictly less work. The kernel body is trivial
bookkeeping, but every word was written with a **system-scope release** store.

A microbenchmark at that exact shape (`/root/p512/settle_bench.cu`, best-of-3
with rotated variant order — GPU idle clocks drop to 210 MHz and can skew a
run 3.4x):

| tickets | release (was) | rlx+2fence | plain+1fence | rlx+1fence | **rlx+0fence** | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 159.4 | 119.5 | 48.3 | 49.0 | **11.6** | 13.8x |
| 2 | 273.8 | 189.5 | 50.4 | 50.7 | **12.5** | 21.8x |
| 4 | 442.8 | 310.6 | 53.8 | 53.8 | **14.9** | 29.8x |
| 8 | 792.4 | 543.6 | 66.0 | 64.8 | **19.0** | 41.8x |

**The cost is the fence count, not the store count and not PCIe latency.**
Relaxed and plain stores are nearly flat in ticket count — the writes pipeline
fine. Release scales linearly, because each store waits. One
`__threadfence_system()` measures ~37 us on its own in this shape.

### Why relaxed is correct here

Every word this kernel writes is read on the far side of a **kernel-completion
boundary**, and kernel completion is itself a system-scope release:

- `host_commit[0]`/`[1]` (the mapped commit mirror) are read by the
  `cudaLaunchHostFunc` completion callback — the unmapped path issues a D2H
  copy at exactly the same point, which is the proof that no reader is
  intra-kernel — and by `settle_readiness` after a `cudaStreamSynchronize`.
- The ring words are read by the guest, which that same callback wakes, and by
  a later `k_pull_validate_host_channels_batch` on the same stream.
- The one edge the protocol actually needs — **payload before ring tail** — is
  supplied by `k_scatter_host_publish_copies` being a **prior kernel**, which
  `channels.hpp` already documented.

Relaxed system-scope atomics keep atomicity (no torn 64-bit word reaches the
host, unlike plain stores) and give up only ordering that nothing observes.
For the same reason `k_scatter_host_publish_copies`'s trailing
`__threadfence_system()` went too — its own comment already called it
belt-and-braces over the launch boundary, and it was ~100% of that kernel.

### Result

Per decode step, `nsys --cuda-graph-trace=node`, same workload:

| kernel | before | after | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `k_settle_host_channels_batch` | 133.3 us | **37.0 us** | 3.6x |
| `k_scatter_host_publish_copies` | 35.2 us | **3.5 us** | 10.1x |
| `k_pull_validate_host_channels_batch` | 28.7 us | 30.4 us | untouched |

The host-channel pipeline drops from **0.86% to 0.33% of pie's GPU time**.

### ⚠ NO THROUGHPUT CLAIM IS MADE — A DIRECT A/B CONFIRMS IT IS UNDETECTABLE

The sharpest possible test was run: **pie(before) vs pie(after)**, same box,
same session, two prebuilt `_engine.so` binaries hot-swapped between runs so
there is no rebuild gap, 8 pairs with alternating within-pair order.

| pair | before | after | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 31129.3 | 32412.1 | +4.12% |
| 2 | 26683.8 | 31799.5 | +19.17% |
| 3 | 30583.8 | 29146.9 | -4.70% |
| 4 | 31644.7 | 31500.9 | -0.45% |
| 5 | 31667.1 | 31543.5 | -0.39% |
| 6 | 31515.8 | 32272.8 | +2.40% |
| 7 | 30558.3 | 31277.3 | +2.35% |
| 8 | 31200.2 | 31032.7 | -0.54% |

**after wins 4 of 8 — a coin flip.** Excluding pair 2 (a collapsed `before` run
at 26684, the load artefact this box produces every few runs) the paired
log-ratio is **+0.36% +/- 1.09% (SE), t = 0.33**. The point estimate brackets
the +0.53% predicted from the GPU-time saving, and that is the most that can
be said: **the confidence interval is 3x the effect, so this neither confirms
nor refutes it.**

A pie-vs-vLLM ABBA alongside it read 0.983, with pie's own spread at 3.3%
against vLLM's 0.7% — all the variance is pie's host-CPU sensitivity, not the
change.

Contrast §20.34's calibrator: ~1.4% effect, 8 of 8 pairs in one direction.
**At loadavg 15-28 this box resolves ~1.5%, not 0.5%.** Sub-1% GPU-time work
cannot be validated end-to-end here at all, so changes of this size must be
argued from deterministic instrument counts rather than tok/s — which is what
this section does. The wall-clock effect remains owed a quiet-box
(loadavg < 8) run.

### Left on the table

`k_pull_validate_host_channels_batch` (30 us/step) uses `load_system_acquire`
per word. It was NOT relaxed: unlike the settlement stores, a relaxed load
there would drop the "tail > head implies the payload at head is valid" edge
that later kernels in the launch depend on, and the reasoning is subtler than
the ~0.08% at stake. Worth revisiting only with a proper argument.

After this change pie's remaining pie-only GPU cost is ~0.33% (channels)
plus a PTIR kernel that is at the memory roof. **There is no longer a
programmability tax large enough to explain the vLLM gap** — which relocates
the question back to the shared attention/GEMM path.
