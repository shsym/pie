//! `pie config tune` — measure this machine instead of remembering someone
//! else's.
//!
//! `optimize` until the rename; `pie model build` builds an artifact and
//! this one tunes a machine, and one verb could not carry both.
//!
//! One boot, many rounds. The design and the arguments behind it are in
//! `.wiki/plan/config-optimize.md`; what matters here is the three rules the
//! command surface enforces:
//!
//!   * **An objective has to be stated.** `latency` and `throughput` pull
//!     opposite ways, so there is no unqualified "optimal" to search for. A
//!     config still saying `auto` names no objective and the flag is required.
//!   * **Reporting is the default.** `--write` applies. The inverse of the usual
//!     `--dry-run` arrangement, deliberately: this harness is young, and an
//!     unverified optimiser that writes by default puts confident wrong numbers
//!     into an operator's config.
//!   * **Nothing is truncated silently.** `--budget` bounds candidates, and what
//!     it cut is printed. So is every axis this command does not yet touch.
