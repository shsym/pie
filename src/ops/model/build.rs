//! `pie model build` — precompute a serve boot, offline.
//!
//! The command `author_abi.cpp` was built to serve, finally landed the way
//! the migration made possible: no FFI at all. The same family author a
//! driver boot runs (`model::contract::author`) writes the serve
//! contract here, the loader compiles it, the streaming host executor
//! materializes it, and the result is a `.zt` whose tensors are the *runtime*
//! tensors — fused QKV banks, stacked experts, requantized weights — under
//! the names the bind path reads. The expensive transforms happen once,
//! offline; loading the optimized artifact afterwards is extent writes.
//!
//! `pie model import` stays the family-blind sibling: it normalizes
//! encodings and touches nothing else. This command is the family-aware
//! step behind the same store, and the split is the one the convert header
//! promised ("family-aware steps slot in behind the same command").
//!
//! What is out of scope, stated rather than implied:
//!
//! * **Tensor parallelism.** A tp>1 materialization is one artifact *per
//!   rank*; the store has no vocabulary for that yet, so `tp_size` is 1.
//! * **Native MXFP4 (Marlin) layouts.** `Repack` is a device-kernel layout
//!   with no host implementation; the host executor refuses the plan. The
//!   routed-decode lowering materializes fine.
//! * **Streamed expert groups.** A group is a paging decision; materializing
//!   one eagerly would build exactly the residency it exists to avoid.
//!
//! Which driver the artifact is for is `--backend`, and it is not cosmetic:
//! CUDA binds fused q/k/v banks under HuggingFace names, while Metal and
//! Vulkan bind in-place projections under MLX names, and an artifact
//! materialized for one family is not what the other's bind path reads. It
//! defaults to `cuda`, which is what the policy silently was before the flag
//! existed.
//!
//! `--backend metal` needed the family schemas to accept their own output
//! first. A serve boot re-authors from *checkpoint* names, so an artifact
//! whose tensors are the runtime tensors is fed back through the rename that
//! produced them; before `mlx::already_lowered` that refused with "Metal llama
//! schema has no declared mapping or skip for 'final_norm.weight'".
