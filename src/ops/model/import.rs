//! `pie model import` — rewrite any checkpoint as pie's canonical artifact,
//! fetching it first when the source is a repo ID that is not here yet.
//!
//! The conversion engine. Format diversity is handled here, once, and never
//! again: what the runtime serves is always one `.zt` file, so the question
//! "which files make up this model, and in what format" is answered at import
//! rather than at every serve boot.
//!
//! The command's contract with the user: everything it does is work the engine
//! would do at load time anyway, done ahead of time, with results that are
//! bit-identical to a cold load. What runs is *derived*, never chosen by flag —
//! the knobs are operational (`--dry-run`, `--force`, `--delete-source`) or
//! about placement (`--out`), never about what the artifact means.
//!
//! Every checkpoint converts the same way. Tensors whose encoding the loader
//! can decode (GGUF's blocked schemes) decode to plain dtypes; everything else
//! is copied byte for byte, keeping its encoding — `.zt` carries quantization
//! schemes parametrically, so the copy is exact. What the format then gives for
//! free is the point of the exercise: every tensor lands on a 64 KiB page of
//! its own (what lets the driver mmap-stream routed experts), carries an XXH3
//! digest, and records its provenance in the file.
//!
//! Passthrough tensors stream from the source through a bounded buffer, so
//! converting a checkpoint far larger than memory is fine; only the decoded set
//! is ever resident, and only GGUF checkpoints decode today.
//!
//! The family-aware step landed as its own command: `pie model build`
//! identifies the checkpoint against the catalog, authors the serve contract
//! through `model::contract` — no FFI, no driver — and materializes it
//! offline. This command stays the family-blind half of the pair: it does not
//! know or ask what model this is.
