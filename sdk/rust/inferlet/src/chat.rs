//! Chat-template templating + parsing.
//!
//! Two halves:
//!
//! 1. **Fillers** ([`system`], [`user`], [`assistant`], [`cue`], [`seal`])
//!    produce token sequences for the model's chat template. The
//!    [`Context`](crate::Context) calls them through its `system` /
//!    `user` / `cue` / `seal` methods; for inferlets that build prompts
//!    by hand (no Context buffering), these are the public entry points.
//!
//! 2. **Decoder** ([`Decoder`], [`Event`]) parses the model's generated
//!    tokens back into visible text + structural events.
//!
//! Both halves wrap the host's `pie:instruct/chat` interface — chat
//! template knowledge lives in the Pie runtime, not in the SDK.
