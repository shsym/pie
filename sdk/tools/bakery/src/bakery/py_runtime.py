"""Python WASM runtime install/check helpers.

Pie's Python inferlets are built with `factored-componentize-py` — a
"factored" build that imports a `componentize-py-runtime` core module
from the host instead of bundling the whole interpreter into each WASM.
The host loads that core module from `$PIE_HOME/py-runtime/shared/*.wasm`,
so the runtime tarball must be present before any Python inferlet can
actually run.

This module is shared between bakery (which fetches at build time so
the WASM is immediately runnable) and the pie-server engine (which
fetches lazily on startup). Both call paths converge on
`ensure_installed()`.
