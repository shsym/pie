/**
 * How long (microseconds) a pipeline may hold a frame's wait-set without
 * submitting before the engine stops waiting for it.
 * 
 * A frame does not dispatch until every participating pipeline has
 * submitted its slot, so membership is a promise to keep submitting, and
 * this is that promise's bound. The clock is per pipeline, measures
 * CONSECUTIVE silence while actually blocking a seal, and is suspended
 * whenever the engine is what the pipeline is waiting on — so it is not a
 * latency budget and a pipeline that keeps submitting can never trip it
 * however long it runs.
 * 
 * A pipeline that intends to stop — blocked on a user turn, waiting on a
 * peer, or simply done for now — calls `forward.park` instead, which
 * leaves the wait-set and stops the clock. What this bound catches is
 * therefore only the case the engine cannot otherwise distinguish: a
 * member that will never submit again.
 * 
 * Small (50ms by default) because it measures a much narrower interval
 * than its size suggests: run-ahead, an unsettled dispatch, a bind in
 * flight and `forward.park` all stop the clock, so what is left is a
 * pipeline hard-blocking the seal with nothing owed to it. It is not
 * smaller because the one-off cost of BUILDING the first pass of a loop
 * — tracing and compiling it after the prefill result lands — is on the
 * clock and was measured between 5ms and 20ms; a steady decode turnaround
 * is far below that.
 * 
 * The corollary is the one thing a pipeline has to be deliberate about:
 * work done between receiving a result and submitting the next fire is
 * ON the clock, because during it the fleet is stalled on this pipeline
 * and nothing is owed back. Anything that can outlast this bound —
 * tokenizing a large document, compiling a grammar, an RPC, a decision
 * that waits on another pipeline — should be preceded by `forward.park`
 * and is rejoined by simply submitting again. Parking is cheap and
 * unparking is implicit, so when in doubt, park.
 * 
 * Overrunning it is not fatal. The engine simply stops waiting: the slot
 * leaves the frame, already-submitted work still runs, and the next
 * submit rejoins. What it costs is a boundary — so treat this as the
 * budget that keeps you IN each frame, not as a deadline you die to.
 * (Termination is reserved for a pipeline that goes silent for orders of
 * magnitude longer without ever parking, i.e. an abandoned one.)
 * 
 * Static, like frame-size and unlike channel-capacity: guests read it
 * once and size their work against it, so it must not move.
