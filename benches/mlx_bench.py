"""mlx-lm, through the same client every other engine here is measured by.

The reference Apple Silicon serves against. `driver/metal` already diffs
against mlx-lm twice -- `tests/parity/*_mlx_taps.py` compares activations and
`llama_bench`'s gates compare tokens -- but both ask whether the ANSWER agrees.
Neither says how long it took, and the throughput comparisons that decided
Metal's batching were run by hand and thrown away. This is that comparison,
kept.

Two things about mlx-lm's server the numbers depend on, stated rather than
discovered:

* **It has no `ignore_eos`.** Every other harness here pins output length so
  both engines do identical work; mlx-lm stops when the model does. Passing the
  field anyway would be worse than not supporting it -- the server ignores
  unknown keys, so the run would silently measure a different shape. So it is
  refused, and the refusal names `--no-ignore-eos`, which makes the *other*
  engine stop at EOS too. Throughput is still computed from the tokens actually
  produced, which `usage` reports.

* **The socket layer is not the engine.** `--concurrency` maps to mlx-lm's
  `--decode-concurrency`, the way it maps to vLLM's `max_num_seqs` next door.
  But mlx-lm serves from a `ThreadingHTTPServer` whose listen backlog is five
  deep and whose accept loop starves under load: fired all at once, 16 requests
  complete 10 here and 32 complete 8, the rest answered `Connection reset by
  peer`. A refused request was never admitted, so it is offered again rather
  than counted as a failure — and the retries are counted, because a run that
  spent itself at the accept queue is not the measurement it looks like.

The prompt cache is off by default here for the reason the other harnesses turn
it off: a closed-loop client that reuses prompts would otherwise measure the
cache.
