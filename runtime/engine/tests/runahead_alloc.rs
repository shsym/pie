//! **2 + 1 pairwise integration** (masterplan M2): run-ahead decode +
//! in-flight-safe `alloc` top-up — overview §6.1's headroom loop:
//!
//! ```text
//! let want = div_ceil(clen + headroom, page);
//! if want > ws.size() { ws.alloc(want - ws.size()); }  // in-flight safe: grants never disturb existing ids
//! ```
//!
//! It ties **thrust 1** (alpha's stable slot ids — `alloc` never renumbers a live
//! id and, under `ws-slot-ids`, never bumps `generation`, W8) to **thrust 2**
//! (bravo's per-forward write transactions, S4 — two prepared forwards may be
//! outstanding at once). The headroom `alloc` happens *while a run-ahead pass is
//! in flight*; the property under test is that it disturbs neither the in-flight
//! pass's captured geometry (slot ids + generation) nor a second, disjoint
//! prepared pass. Mock/host-only — no driver, no GPU.
//!
//! Run the in-flight-safe regime with `--features ws-slot-ids`; the default
//! (legacy) build documents WHY it is unsafe there (`alloc` bumps the generation
//! a run-ahead pass captured, so its next pass would be stale-rejected).
