//! Recurrent-state fires at frame size k > 1, end to end on the mock driver.
//!
//! Until the RS publication seam moved from finalize to prepare, a pass
//! binding recurrent state could not share a frame: `fire` serialized it
//! behind every predecessor fire's SETTLEMENT, but a frame's fires cannot
//! settle until all of them are submitted — so the frame sat one fire short
//! of sealing forever, and `validate_frame` rejected the shape rather than
//! hanging on it. That collapsed k to 1 for every linear/SSM model.
//!
//! RS mappings now publish at prepare, in slot order, under the store lock,
//! so slot i+1 classifies against slot i's decision without waiting for it.
//! This binary pins `[runtime] frame_size = 3` and runs a GDN/hybrid model (the
//! mock reports a recurrent-state pool, so `model.pass-kind()` is not
//! attention) two ways:
//!
//!  * `generate-gdn` — one live RS slot per frame, the shape that used to be
//!    the ONLY legal one. Proves run-ahead across frames still works.
//!  * `generate-gdn-frame` — every slot of the 3-wide frame binds the same
//!    RS working set. This is the shape the engine used to reject.
//!
//! It lives in its own test binary because the configured k is installed once
//! into a `OnceLock` at bootstrap (`scheduler::configured_frame_size`), so it
//! must be pinned before anything in the process touches the scheduler.
