//! **North-star e2e harness (skeleton)** — the scaffold that ties thrusts 1, 2,
//! and 3 together toward overview §6.1 (MTP speculation + grammar constraint +
//! Quest attention, one pass, three programs) and the masterplan M3 gates.
//!
//! This is bravo's T2-side integration seam. It stands up the structure and
//! proves the slices that are runnable on the mock **today**; the full §6.1
//! composition lands incrementally as the other thrusts converge (see the
//! extension points below). Everything here is mock/host-only — no GPU. The
//! numeric north-star gates (accepted-tokens/s, bubble p50 < 100 µs sustained)
//! are the real-driver (4090) harness's job; this proves *structural*
//! correctness of the composition.
//!
//! ## §6.1 composition — who supplies what
//!
//! | piece                          | thrust | status here |
//! |--------------------------------|--------|-------------|
//! | constrained decode loop (scheduler + working set + program carrier) | **1 + 2 + 3** | proven below (`grammar` §6.1 slice, eval-mock) |
//! | grammar constraint (`argmax(mask_apply(logits, mask))`) | **3** (echo/charlie/delta) | proven below (device mask-apply == host, forced-out) |
//! | run-ahead decode (`submit(t+1)` before `out.take(t)`) | **2** (bravo) | real-driver gate (mock lacks the device carrier); scheduler side proven on mock |
//! | quorum fire rule (F1–F6), depth-1 enqueue | **2** (bravo) | `QuorumPolicy` (unit + fleet-sim tested); wired behind `run-ahead` |
//! | in-flight-safe `alloc` headroom top-up | **2 + 1** | proven in `runahead_alloc.rs` |
//! | MTP speculation (K+1 window, match-verify) | **3** | extension point — building blocks present (`mtp_argmax`/`spec_verify_greedy`/MtpLogits mock support); pending the composed decode-loop inferlet |
//! | Quest page-mask attention sink | **3 + 1** | extension point — pending `attn_page_mask` backend + `envelope_dot` (overview §4, direction-only) |
//! | §6.2 beam search (B lanes in ONE forward) | **1 + 3** | pending — single batched instance ⇒ dodges the multi-pipeline arena bug; likely first full composition to run |
//!
//! ## Extension points (as the thrusts land)
//!
//! 1. **M2 3+2 (C2):** swap the eval-mock's submit-bound grammar mask for a
//!    channel-bit late input — the sampler parks on the channel word, the forward
//!    overlaps. The C2 wait mechanism (device dirty-flag word → channel bit) is
//!    already in place; this harness re-points the grammar slice at it.
//! 2. **M2 3+1 (C1):** flat `fwd.attention(...)` with every geometry descriptor
//!    supplied by device-carried channels the host never reads.
//! 3. **M3 north star:** compose all three programs on one forward — the MTP
//!    epilogue emits drafts, the grammar walk builds the K+1 mask rows, Quest
//!    selects pages per layer — under the quorum scheduler. Add the accepted-
//!    tokens/s + sustained-bubble gates on the real-driver harness.
