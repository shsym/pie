//! # Driver Subsystem
//!
//! One channel per driver — every request travels through the same
//! [`DriverChannel`]. Forward batches, page copies, and adapter loads
//! all share the transport; there is no separate "cold path."
//!
//! Requests and responses are the wire-canonical
//! [`pie_driver_abi::RequestPayload`] / [`pie_driver_abi::ResponsePayload`]
//! enums directly — no pie-internal mirror. The runtime pairs each
//! payload with a routing [`DriverId`] (the same value the wire
//! [`pie_driver_abi::Frame`] carries at its top level) to pick a channel.
//!
//! [`DriverChannel`] has two implementations:
//!   - [`InProcChannel`] — embedded drivers (cuda + metal + dummy
//!     linked into `pie-worker`). Heap-backed queue + condvar wakeup;
//!     the FFI hands the C++ driver a typed view of the request data.
//!   - [`InProcPollingChannel`] — low-latency embedded-driver channel
//!     with the same FFI surface but fixed slots and polling waits
//!     instead of the heap-backed pending map/inbox.
//!   - [`ShmemChannel`] — subprocess drivers (Python `dev`, `vllm`,
//!     `sglang`). POSIX-shmem ring carrying rkyv-encoded frames.
