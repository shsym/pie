//! KV working set — dense ordered page array with relative-index semantics.
//!
//! Lane C / Phase 2. Spec: [[workingset-brief]] §KV working set (W2/W3/W6/W7) and
//! the design note `workingset-kv-design`. This is the structural core; the WIT
//! `HostKvWorkingSet` shell lives in `runtime/src/api/kv_working_set.rs` (echo
//! owns the bindgen `with:` / `add_to_linker` mapping).
//!
//! ## Model
//! A [`KvWorkingSet`] is a dense ordered array of page **slots** plus a
//! `generation` counter. The only references that cross the inferlet API are
//! relative `u32` indices into this array (W2). Slots are **lazily materialised**:
//! `alloc(n)` reserves `n` empty slots, and the physical KV page is allocated from
//! the arena on first write (`cow_write_slot`). A slot is therefore
//! `Option<ObjectId>` — `None` = reserved/empty, `Some(id)` = materialised page
//! object in the unified arena.
//!
//! ## Ownership split (Seam 2, bravo)
//! The unified arena is **one instance per driver**, shared by KV and RS, and owns
//! all refcounting + copy-on-write + physical blocks. The KV layer owns only the
//! dense slot array + generation (per working set) and the [`KvCas`] content-hash
//! index (per model/driver). Every method that touches physical state takes a
//! `&mut Arena` (and, for sealing/release, a `&mut KvCas`) supplied by the caller,
//! so the core is agnostic to where the arena/cas live (echo's `Arc<Mutex<Arena>>`
//! registry).
//!
//! ## Forward contract (echo)
//! `resolve_read` / `resolve_write` (validate-only) / `page_size` / `size` /
//! `generation` / `cow_write_slot` / `seal`, matching the frozen signatures echo
//! drives from the forward-pass txn. CAS sealing reuses
//! `crate::working_set::page_hash::compute_page_hashes` (unchanged).
