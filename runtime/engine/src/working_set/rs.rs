//! RS (recurrent-state) working set — runtime core (Lane D, Phase 3).
//!
//! Backend domain object behind the WIT `rs-working-set` resource and
//! `inference.fold`. It holds a **folded recurrent-state object** (one arena
//! [`ArenaKind::RsSlab`]) plus a dense, ordered array of mutable **buffered
//! page slots**. A forward pass may write buffered RS state WITHOUT folding it
//! (W10); folding into the recurrent state is the separate, explicit `fold(n)`
//! operation (W9). Forks share the folded + buffered objects by arena refcount
//! and copy-on-write the first object that is mutated (W11). `fold(n)` is
//! validated against the model fold granularity BEFORE any driver dispatch.
//!
//! This module depends only on [`crate::arena`] — no WIT/bindgen — so it is
//! unit-testable against a real [`Arena`]. The WIT host binding
//! (`HostRsWorkingSet`) lives in `crate::api::rs_working_set`; `echo`'s forward
//! `execute()` and `delta`'s `inference.fold` call the methods here. The
//! `&mut Arena` each method takes is obtained by the caller from the per-(model,
//! driver) `arena::get(model_idx, driver_idx).lock()` registry handle (sync
//! lock, never held across an await). See the Source note `workingset-rs-design`.
