//! The batch scheduler's fire policy: the **wait-for-all-active-pipelines**
//! quorum rule ([`WaitAllPolicy`], overview §7.2 / thrust-2 F1–F6) — the single
//! scheduling algorithm. Wait until every active pipeline's next pass is ready,
//! then enqueue the dense wave behind the in-flight batch (depth-`max_in_flight`
//! multi-inflight run-ahead, zero bubble); stragglers fire on the wave deadline
//! and demote at the miss limit.
//!
//! ## Pie batching model
//!
//! Pie performs **iteration-level batching**: each in-flight context
//! re-submits a forward-pass request after every token. The scheduler
//! accumulates these into a wave and the rule decides when to fire.
