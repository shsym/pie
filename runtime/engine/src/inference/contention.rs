//! KV contention orchestration — FCFS preempt/restore (Task-B rework).
//!
//! In Gim's directive: KV-cache contention is handled by PREEMPT/RESTORE, not
//! admission. `max_concurrent_processes` is a large physical safety cap only;
//! when a forward's page allocation hits an exhausted pool
//! ([`WorkingSetError::OutOfBlocks`](crate::working_set::kv::WorkingSetError)),
//! the prep seam routes here instead of surfacing an inferlet error:
//!
//! 1. **Victim loop** — FCFS-preempt: suspend the YOUNGEST running process
//!    (latest spawn order; the oldest first-comer's progress is protected)
//!    until the request fits. The physical state-save (D2H stash / drop-to-
//!    replay, grace/refcount/txn guards) is behind [`ReclaimBackend`] —
//!    alpha's working-set wrappers; this module owns only the ORCHESTRATION.
//! 2. **Wait queue** — no victim (the requester is the youngest, or every
//!    peer is pinned/suspended): the requester parks FIFO in `waiters` and is
//!    woken as blocks free. Waiters hold NOTHING while parked (their forward
//!    txn was aborted before `acquire`), so waiting cannot deadlock.
//! 3. **Restore-on-free** — when blocks free and no waiter is parked, the
//!    oldest-suspended process restores (FCFS), gated by the anti-thrash
//!    guard: restore NEVER evicts (`free >= suspended_need`) and is paused
//!    while pool utilization exceeds `restore_pause_at_utilization` (the
//!    prior design's evict→restore→re-evict cascade guard, bootstrap.rs).
//! 4. **Exhaustion endgame (#19)** — a non-terminating guest can grow its
//!    context past the whole pool; the FCFS-oldest keystone then parks
//!    unsatisfiable forever (no victim; restore only consumes free). After
//!    `PIE_KV_EXHAUSTION_MS` of continuous quiet, `acquire` fails LOUD with
//!    [`ContentionError::Exhausted`] (→ `OutOfBlocks` to the guest) instead of
//!    wedging. (Alternative not built: *victim-the-hog* — cold-drop the
//!    survivor's own context to free the pool for the fleet; ship fail-loud.)
//!
//! Blueprint: the deleted `context/sched.rs` `when_allocated`/`drain_queues`
//! (GitHub main, `fa3fe140^`), stripped of its market layer. The prior code
//! deferred ops as closures because the context actor was synchronous; here
//! `execute_impl` is async, so `acquire().await` + retry-the-prep replaces
//! the closure machinery.
//!
//! Lock discipline: `inner` is a plain mutex ordered INSIDE everything else —
//! no [`ReclaimBackend`] call (which may take arena/working-set locks) is
//! ever made while holding it, and no await happens under it.
