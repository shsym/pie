//! `KvPreparedWrite`: the per-fire prepared KV operation (kv_refact.md,
//! `store/kv/write.rs`).
//!
//! Holds freshly allocated physical ids and the CoW copy plan until prepare
//! publishes them into the single table state.
//!
//! Complete typed-store API (kv_refact.md): some methods here are not yet
//! called by the live single-model fire path (only a subset of the typed
//! store surface is currently wired) but are exercised by this module's
//! own unit test suite and reserved for upcoming increments (contention/
//! reclaim expansion, RS buffer-write paths, etc.) — kept rather than
//! deleted, allowed rather than silently masked.
