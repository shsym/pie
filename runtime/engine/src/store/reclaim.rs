//! The reclaim ladder — FCFS preempt/restore over the KV physical pool. This
//! module manages pages, so it lives in `store/` even though the fire path
//! is what triggers it. `ContentionOrchestrator`/`ContentionMode`/etc. keep
//! their working names; the file/module name (`store::reclaim`) is the
//! contract.
//!
//! In Gim's directive: KV-cache contention is handled by PREEMPT/RESTORE, not
//! admission. `max_concurrent_processes` is a large physical safety cap only;
//! when a forward's page allocation hits an exhausted pool
//! ([`KvStoreError::OutOfPages`](crate::store::kv::KvStoreError) — typed, and
//! raised only at forward preparation because `reserve` is logical), the fire
//! path's prepare seam routes here instead of surfacing an inferlet error:
//!
//! 0. **Idle-lease rung** — the ladder's first step (kv_refact.md Scheduler):
//!    drop cache-root leases nothing live reaches
//!    ([`ReclaimBackend::reclaim_idle`] →
//!    `KvStore::drop_unused_cache_leases`). Pure cache, no work lost; only
//!    if pressure remains does the victim loop run.
//! 1. **Victim loop** — FCFS-preempt: suspend the YOUNGEST running process
//!    (latest spawn order; the oldest first-comer's progress is protected)
//!    until the request fits. The physical state-save (D2H stash / drop-to-
//!    replay, grace/refcount/txn guards) is behind [`ReclaimBackend`] —
//!    alpha's working-set wrappers; this module owns only the ORCHESTRATION.
//! 2. **Unified grant order** — blocked allocations and suspended restores
//!    compete by original `submit_seq`. Grants reserve concrete device ids, so
//!    a racing caller cannot bypass an older entitlement.
//! 3. **Restore-on-free** — the oldest eligible unified entry proceeds. A
//!    non-fitting restore holds its slot and never evicts; a utilization-paused
//!    restore voluntarily yields until its anti-thrash pause ages out.
//! 4. **Exhaustion endgame (#19)** — a non-terminating guest can grow its
//!    context past the whole pool; the FCFS-oldest keystone then parks
//!    unsatisfiable forever (no victim; restore only consumes free). After
//!    `PIE_KV_EXHAUSTION_MS` of continuous quiet, `acquire` fails LOUD with
//!    [`ContentionError::Exhausted`] (→ `OutOfPages` to the guest) instead of
//!    wedging. (Alternative not built: *victim-the-hog* — cold-drop the
//!    survivor's own context to free the pool for the fleet; ship fail-loud.)
//!
//! Blueprint: the deleted `context/sched.rs` `when_allocated`/`drain_queues`
//! (GitHub main, `fa3fe140^`), stripped of its market layer. The prior code
//! deferred ops as closures because the context actor was synchronous; here
//! `execute_impl` is async, so `acquire().await` + retry-the-prep replaces
//! the closure machinery.
//!
//! Lock discipline: `inner` is a plain mutex ordered INSIDE everything else —
//! no [`ReclaimBackend`] call (which may take arena/working-set locks) is
//! ever made while holding it, and no await happens under it.
