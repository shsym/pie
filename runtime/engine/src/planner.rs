//! Project Rainer — the residency planner (design: `rainer.md`).
//!
//! One decision replaces the retired preempt/restore negotiation (the
//! `store::reclaim` ladder): **membership**. A process is either RESIDENT —
//! its fires reserve straight off the pool free lists with no planner
//! involvement at all — or it is out of the resident set: structurally
//! quiescent, its KV working sets on host swap, its guest task parked at the
//! residency gate. Membership changes are planner-owned and planner-executed;
//! nothing is negotiated with the victim.
//!
//! - **FCFS by spawn.** Registration order is the single priority key. The
//!   oldest unmet ask — a parked allocation or an evictee's restore — is the
//!   HEAD; every freed page is physically pulled into the planner's
//!   accumulation until the head's demand is covered. Younger asks wait
//!   behind it, so drainage is monotone and victim/restore thrash cannot
//!   oscillate: a victim is younger than the head it funded, and its restore
//!   entry queues behind every older ask.
//! - **The hot path pays nothing.** With no waiters and everyone resident
//!   (two relaxed atomic loads), `acquire` is two free-list pops. There is
//!   no global grant mutex, no queue bookkeeping, no notify arming — the
//!   per-fire toll that cost −17% roomy throughput (CONTENTION_FOLLOWUP.md
//!   §13) is deleted structurally.
//! - **Eviction is sized and aimed, never negotiated** (`planner::exec`):
//!   fence the victim's working sets (an atomic paired with the fire lease),
//!   drain its detachable tail, wait for lease quiescence, then
//!   prepare → D2H → commit on the planner's own task. No safe points, no
//!   park requests, no victim cooperation, no per-victim state machine.
//! - **Restores are accumulation-gated.** An evicted process re-queues at
//!   its spawn position; the oldest evictee boards alone when the
//!   accumulation covers its swapped set. A thundering herd is
//!   unrepresentable: evictions are deficit-sized from the youngest edge and
//!   restores are funded one head at a time.
//! - **No timers, no knobs.** Exhaustion is arithmetic — an ask larger than
//!   the pool fails loud ([`PlannerError::Impossible`]), a head whose own
//!   holdings plus its ask exceed the pool is the hog endgame
//!   ([`PlannerError::Hog`]). There is no progress deadline and no kill rung.
//!
//! Lock discipline: `inner` is a plain mutex ordered INSIDE everything else —
//! no port/store call is made and no reservation is dropped while holding
//! it. Every mutation funnels through `with_inner`, which recomputes the two
//! lock-free hot-path counters (`waiters`, `nonresident`) on the way out.
