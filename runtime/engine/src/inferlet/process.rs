// staged cohort into working-set declaration, KV reservation and prefill
// construction at exactly the instant the boundary frame is trying to
// gather. That cohort does not run for another generation; the successors
// that ARE on the critical path already hold their permits (bind is always
// acquired before execution). So the release is pure interference: measured
// per boundary, 512 `process_bind_admitted` land inside the same window as
// the 512 admissions that matter, and the one boundary that carries no
// staged binds — the last — is consistently the shortest of the run.
//
// The gate parks released permits while the frame policy has a join in
// flight and hands them over once the boundary frame is away.

// LIVENESS: the hold is asserted by the scheduler pass and is cleared

// flight, i.e. the moment the engine has nothing left to do. A hold can
// therefore never be the last thing standing: whatever it defers is
// released before the engine can idle on it. (A process parked on bind
// admission also cannot be what a join is waiting for — `joins_in_flight`
// is populated at execution-slot consumption, which is downstream of bind
// admission on the same task.)
//
// SCOPE: process-global, like the pools it gates — `ADMISSION`,
// `BIND_ADMISSION`, `PREWARM_ADMISSION` and `EXECUTION_SLOT_CAPACITY` are all
// `OnceLock`s set once by `init_admission`. A second engine in the same

// the semaphores themselves already impose. Reset is by process exit only:
