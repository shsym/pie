//! Fire RS (recurrent-state) preparation over the typed `RsStore`
//! (kv_refact.md). The GDN / linear-attention forward writes the advanced
//! folded state INTO the folded slot directly (the driver's in-forward
//! `commit_len` path): [`prepare_many`] classifies every folded-slot target
//! (fresh+reset / CoW-after-fork / in-place), PUBLISHES the resulting mapping
//! under the same store lock — in guest submission order, before the launch
//! reaches the scheduler, exactly as `fire::kv::prepare` does — and returns
//! the driver lowering (`rs_slot_ids`, `rs_slot_flags`, pre-launch d2d copy)
//! plus an [`RsTxn`] receipt the fire holds until [`settle`].
//!
//! Publishing at prepare is what lets RS fires run ahead: a successor
//! prepared before its predecessor completes classifies against a mapping
//! that already carries the predecessor's decision, so it can neither RESET
//! a slot twice nor re-CoW an already-privatized one. The advanced state's
//! CONTENTS are ordered by the pipeline stream, which the pre-launch CoW copy
//! already relies on.
//!
//! The allow below covers exactly the singular test-exercised convenience
//! wrapper ([`prepare`]) around the `_many` production entries — kept rather
//! than deleted, allowed rather than silently masked.
