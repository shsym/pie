//! Device-geometry page leasing (plan W3.3) + device-geometry pass detection.
//!
//! A device-geometry pass (its `pages`/`w_slot` descriptor ports are produced by
//! the program on-device — the generalized §6.2 beam) needs the runtime to grant
//! PHYSICAL pages the device writes new-token K/V into, since the host no longer
//! knows the per-fire geometry. Physical-space page ids from the start (§3.2):
//! the runtime seeds fire 0's pages and grants `B` fresh physical ids per submit;
//! the whole loop stays physical and the driver needs no slot→physical table.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   * fire 0: `B` pages granted as the seed (one live page per lane).
//!   * each submit: `B` fresh pages granted, delivered to the program as a
//!     host-put on its fresh-page input channel (D1-coalesced).
//!   * after a fire commits: the harvested `w_cont` (per-lane "continued a shared
//!     tail in place" vs "forked a fresh page") says which fresh grants were
//!     UNUSED (a continuing heir did not consume its fresh page) — reclaim them.
//!   * pass drop / failure: reclaim everything.
//!
//! Pin float is bounded by `(run-ahead depth) × B` pages (each in-flight fire
//! holds at most its `B` fresh grants until it commits + reclaims).
//!
//! [`PageLease`] is the PURE bookkeeping half (grant / reclaim / free-list),
//! unit-tested here; the working-set page allocation + the host-put wiring live
//! in `pipeline/fire/mod.rs` (they need the arena / ws, which need a device).
//! [`detect_device_geometry`] + [`DevGeo`] are the paired bind-time detector
//! and per-pass lease bundle.
//!
//! Complete pipeline domain API: some methods here (relaxed geometry
//! variants, per-channel introspection, the pure `instantiate`/registry
//! probe entry points, device-geometry lease internals) are not yet
//! called by the current single-model/mock-driver fire path, but are
//! exercised by this module's own unit tests and reserved for upcoming
//! wiring (multi-pass channels, device-geometry beams) — kept rather
//! than deleted, allowed rather than silently masked.
