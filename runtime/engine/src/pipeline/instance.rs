//! Instance construction (thrust-3 P2.2) — the host-side `instantiate`
//! logic behind the WIT `pipeline.instantiate`.
//!
//! An **instance** is one binding of a registered program (the trace identity)
//! to its per-instance state: the seed values for its `seeded` channels
//! (`Channel::from` data — D2, never part of registration/identity) and the set
//! of host-facing channels the guest can drive. The device channel arena is
//! allocated driver-side from the declared shapes; the host instance carries the
//! validated seeds to send at instantiation plus the host-channel index map.
//!
//! Complete pipeline domain API: some methods here (relaxed geometry
//! variants, per-channel introspection, the pure `instantiate`/registry
//! probe entry points, device-geometry lease internals) are not yet
//! called by the current single-model/mock-driver fire path, but are
//! exercised by this module's own unit tests and reserved for upcoming
//! wiring (multi-pass channels, device-geometry beams) — kept rather
//! than deleted, allowed rather than silently masked.
