//! Vesuvius frame scheduling — THE scheduler policy: the
//! **wait-for-all-active-lanes** quorum rule at frame granularity. Wait
//! until every awaited lane's next FRAME is fully submitted, then seal the
//! dense epoch and dispatch its k waves in slot order.
//!
//! Every deployment routes here, including `PIE_FRAME_SIZE=1`:
//! a 1-slot frame IS a wave, so k = 1 reproduces the per-wave wait-all
//! barrier (each tracked fire arrives as its own single-fire frame; a seal
//! boundary is a wave boundary). The former per-wave `WaitAllPolicy`
//! (scheduler/quorum.rs) was this policy specialized to k = 1 and is folded
//! in — its run-ahead depth lever, cold hold, and watchdog constants live
//! here now.
//!
//! A *frame* is k consecutive waves submitted as one unit per lane: the guest
//! supplies exactly k ordered slots (`forward.submit`), slot i executes in
//! wave i, and a `none` slot is a no-op for that wave. The scheduler:
//!
//! - collects per-lane frame submissions (each fire carries a
//!   [`FrameStamp`]);
//! - HOLDS the next seal until every awaited lane's oldest queued frame is
//!   arrival-complete — the infinite wait-all rule: membership changes only
//!   through explicit close/leave/first-fire events, and the 1 s watchdog
//!   only REPORTS a non-responsive lane, never evicts it;
//! - holds while a JOIN is in flight: a process in bring-up (bind
//!   accepted, no fire yet) is staged; once it acquires a contended
//!   execution permit it is a join-in-flight the seal waits for by
//!   identity, and while a freed slot has a staged taker the seal waits
//!   for that handoff — so a cohort turnover gathers the incoming herd
//!   instead of sealing narrow epochs. A bind alone holds nothing: a
//!   live rebinder is already wait-set-held through its lane, and an
//!   unadmitted process cannot fire;
//! - seals from every ready lane (deterministic first-fit in lane-id order
//!   against the per-wave token/row budgets — pure arithmetic over declared
//!   demand, never timing). A lane deferred by capacity is served in the
//!   same structurally partitioned round without re-awaiting the lanes
//!   already served ([`FramePolicy::round_served`], the quorum's round rule);
//! - seals EARLY and overlaps frames on-stream: the next frame seals the
//!   moment the wait-all gate holds — normally while the current frame
//!   executes — and its waves post behind the executing frame's tail at
//!   the run-ahead depth. There is no launch-time barrier: the driver's
//!   device-side readiness gate (`pass_commit` channel tickets) orders
//!   dependent fires by stream order, and a frame-boundary dependency is
//!   structurally identical to an intra-frame one. Posting is globally
//!   ordered (seal order across frames, slot order within one), a RETRY
//!   replays through the globally wave-ordered makeup set, and settlement
//!   only gates resource reclamation, never a launch;
//! - releases a gracefully closed lane from the wait-set immediately while
//!   its accepted frames drain to settlement.
//!
//! The policy is a pure state machine: the worker owns the queue and the
//! driver lane, and drives this through the `on_*` bookkeeping calls plus
//! [`FramePolicy::plan_dispatch`]. Every fire id that enters a sealed
//! frame leaves it through exactly one of `on_fires_posted` →
//! `on_fire_retired` (possibly cycling through the makeup set on RETRY) or
//! `on_fire_dropped` (rejected while queued).
