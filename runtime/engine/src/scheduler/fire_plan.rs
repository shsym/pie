//! Fire planning: the device-independent half of "how do these co-batch".
//!
//! [`LaunchGrouping::accepts`](super::worker::LaunchGrouping) answers *can*
//! these members share one step; this module answers *how* — the row order
//! and, per divergence site, a lowering. It is the port of the tart
//! prototype's planner vocabulary (`tart/plan.py` + `tart/ir.py`,
//! re-measured on L40S in `stage0-l40s.md`) into the home plan.md Part 2 and
//! pie-application-plan.md §4.3 assign it: beside the admission rule, in the
//! scheduler, because only the scheduler sees the model's divergence sites,
//! the attached programs, the device cost model, and what was admitted.
//!
//! v0 was deliberately narrow: [`plan_fire`] re-derives, as data, exactly
//! the decisions the scheduler already makes in scattered places — the
//! `(device_resolved_geometry, hook_program)` stable sort in
//! `batch::build_frame_submission` and the two per-site fast-path choices
//! the driver used to re-derive on its own (see [`SITE_QKV_POSTPROCESS`]
//! and [`SITE_PROJECTION_WEIGHTS`]). The member order is consumed and
//! asserted equivalent to the sort it replaces, and since B the
//! [`SITE_QKV_POSTPROCESS`] lowering is CONSUMED too: its
//! `Prefix{fast_rows}` is converted to wire rows
//! (`batch::planned_prefix_wire_rows`) and crossed to the driver as
//! `planned_hook_free_prefix_rows`, where it feeds the declared Peel's
//! split after a cross-check against the driver's compiled-plan
//! derivation. When the next divergence axis lands it lands as one more
//! [`Site`], not as a fourth hard-coded mechanism.
//!
//! Per pie-application-plan.md §4.4 the planner emits candidates, not final
//! answers: class assignment is structural and device-independent, and a
//! later increment lets the runtime pick among candidate lowerings with
//! device cost. v0 has one candidate per site, so the distinction is latent.
//!
//! # Two site provenances
//!
//! Sites arrive from two distinct sources, and the split is semantic, not
//! historical:
//!
//! * **Member facts** — per-fire *attachment* divergence: what the admitted
//!   programs brought with them (attention hooks, a lora sink). These vary
//!   fire to fire and are derived here in [`plan_fire`] from
//!   [`MemberFacts`]; [`SITE_QKV_POSTPROCESS`] and
//!   [`SITE_PROJECTION_WEIGHTS`] are this provenance.
//! * **The traced form** — *model-structural* divergence: what the model
//!   itself declares, true for every member of every fire against it. An
//!   MoE trace's per-token expert selection ([`SITE_EXPERT_WEIGHTS`]) is
//!   this provenance; [`site_table::derive_sites`] walks a
//!   `pie_forward::ForwardPlan` and emits them once per model, not per
//!   fire.
//!
//! [`plan_fire_with_model`] merges both: `build_frame_submission` passes
//! the model-structural sites the driver's capabilities handshake reported
//! from its validated plan ([`site_table::summary_sites`]; the [`site_table`]
//! module doc records why the driver, not the engine, is the honest source).
