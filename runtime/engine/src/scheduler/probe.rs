//! Per-fire scheduler lifecycle probes.
//!
//! Gated by the `profile-fire` Cargo feature. With the feature off,
//! the `probe_fire!` macro expands to a body-only no-op (no
//! `Instant::now()`, no `fetch_add`) — the holder structs and atomics
//! are still defined so callers and readers compile, but probe sites
//! produce no code.
//!
//! ## Hierarchy
//!
//! ```text
//! FireProbes
//! ├── inter_fire_us            sibling — gap between consecutive fire starts
//! ├── post_dispatch_to_fire_us sibling — gap from dispatch end to next fire
//! ├── last_fire_spawn_micros   timestamp (always-on, cheap)
//! ├── last_dispatch_end_micros timestamp (always-on, cheap)
//! ├── accumulate.*             before-fire host work
//! ├── pre_dispatch.*           between fire-decision and execute
//! ├── execute.*                the hot path; children sum to total_us
//! └── post_dispatch.*          after-execute host work
//! ```
//!
//! **Invariant**: `execute.total_us` should equal `batch_build_us +
//! driver_fire_us` within probe overhead.
//!
//! **Sibling vs nested**: `inter_fire_us` and `post_dispatch_to_fire_us`
//! are NOT contained in any `execute.*` probe — they measure gaps
//! *between* fires, not work done during a fire. Don't sum them with
//! children of `execute`.
//!
//! ## Quorum-rule probes (`quorum.*`)
//!
//! The quorum fire rule (overview §7.2, thrust-2 §3 F1–F6) needs a
//! dedicated probe family. These
//! land as scaffolding in phase S0 and are populated by the quorum core
//! in phase S5; until then they read zero. Each maps to a clause or a
//! health signal of the rule:
//!
//! ```text
//! FireProbes.quorum
//! ├── inter_batch_bubble_us  device idle between one batch retiring and the next launching (F1 target: →0)
//! ├── quorum_latency_us      last-pipeline-ready → dense-batch enqueue (F1 quorum completion)
//! ├── escape_fires           count of F2 idle-escape fires (ready subset fired on device-idle+empty-queue)
//! ├── cold_hold_us           time spent in the F3 cold-hold window (nothing in flight)
//! ├── cold_hold_fires        count of fires that went through the F3 cold-hold path
//! ├── straggler_fires        count of narrow fires after the wave window expired (straggler demotion)
//! └── readiness_miss         count of dummy-runs: a pass launched structurally-ready whose late edge missed (M3 gate: rate < 1%)
//! ```
