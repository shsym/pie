//! Batch scheduling policies.
//!
//! Three policies live here, in order of increasing patience:
//!
//!   - `GreedyPolicy` — fire immediately, zero waiting.
//!   - `EagerPolicy` — wait for the *peer cohort* to gather, then fire
//!     even if the GPU is still finishing the previous batch (the
//!     scheduler's semaphore handles GPU contention).
//!   - `AdaptivePolicy` (default) — wait for the peer cohort *and* the
//!     GPU before firing. Kept in `Wait` while the GPU is busy so
//!     incoming arrivals during decode keep growing the next batch.
//!
//! Selection via the per-model `[model.X.scheduler.policy]` field in
//! the TOML config (default = `adaptive`). The other two are retained
//! as references: greedy for sanity-checking the scheduler itself,
//! eager as a slightly simpler alternative that's marginally faster
//! in pure steady-state and marginally slower under bursty / churning
//! workloads.
//!
//! ## Design history (why these are what they are)
//!
//! Pie performs **iteration-level batching**: each in-flight context
//! re-submits a forward-pass request after every token. The scheduler
//! accumulates these into a batch and the policy decides when to fire.
//!
//! An earlier version of this file used `AdaptiveThroughputPolicy`,
//! which fired when `idle > ref_l/B` (where `ref_l` was a leaky-max
//! of observed batch latencies, decayed by `0.9999` per batch). The
//! intuition was: bigger batches need shorter waits because they're
//! already "full enough". That policy had three failure modes that
//! showed up clearly under benchmark:
//!
//!   1. **Low-RPS over-wait.** With a single in-flight context, B=1
//!      and `ref_l/B = ref_l`. The 50 ms `max_wait_time` cap fires
//!      the batch every iteration, paying ~50 ms of pure waiting per
//!      token. Per-request latency at RPS=1 was ~3× a no-wait
//!      baseline.
//!
//!   2. **Idle-phase pathology under churn.** `ref_l` is a max-ratchet,
//!      so once a high-RPS phase elevates it, decay is glacial
//!      (half-life ~7000 batches). A subsequent idle phase still has
//!      `ref_l` at the old peak, so every B=1 batch waits its full
//!      50 ms cap. Idle-phase p50 of 995 ms vs 541 ms for the new
//!      policy under a 0.5↔64 RPS churn pattern.
//!
//!   3. **Premature mid-burst fire.** As B ramps up during peer
//!      accumulation, `ref_l/B` shrinks aggressively. A 0.5 ms gap
//!      between two peer arrivals at B=4 trips `idle > ref_l/B` and
//!      the batch fires fragmented (`B=4` fired with `pinned=13` in
//!      instrumented runs). Stragglers go in the next batch and pay
//!      an extra full iteration of latency.
//!
//! Several intermediate fixes were tried — adding a "cohort cap"
//! (`B >= pinned_count → fire`), faster `DECAY`, idle-based grace
//! periods, λ-tracking — and the path through them led to the
//! present design, which is **simpler than any intermediate**:
//!
//!   - The cohort cap alone fixes (1) and (2).
//!   - Removing the `idle > ref_l/B` rule entirely fixes (3).
//!   - That removal also drops the need for `DECAY` smoothing,
//!     since the latency value is no longer used as a
//!     sensitivity-amplified budget.
//!
//! That cohort-cap-plus-bound design is `EagerPolicy` below. Adding
//! a GPU-busy gate on top — keeping the policy in `Wait` while the
//! device is occupied — yields `AdaptivePolicy`. The gate has a small
//! consistent benefit under churn (~20 ms p50 improvement on average,
//! up to ~50 ms on saturated bursts) at the cost of a similarly small
//! steady-state regression. Promoted to default because the workloads
//! Pie targets are bursty.

// =============================================================================
// AdaptivePolicy — the default. Cohort cap + GPU-busy gate + safety bound.
// =============================================================================
//
// **Firing rule** (in evaluation order):
//
//   1. `B >= max_batch_size`              — structural device limit.
//   2. `last_latency == 0`                — cold start, no measurement
//                                           yet; fire to make progress.
//   3. `in_flight`                        — GPU is occupied by the
//                                           previous batch. Wait.
//                                           Arrivals during the wait
//                                           grow this batch.
//   4. `B >= pinned_count(device)`        — every active peer is in
//                                           the batch (cohort cap).
//                                           Fire.
//   5. `start.elapsed() >= last_latency`  — safety bound. Waiting
//                                           longer than one batch's
//                                           compute time costs more
//                                           in queue delay than any
//                                           plausible saving from a
//                                           larger batch.
//   otherwise: `Wait(last_latency - start.elapsed())`
//
// Conditions (3)–(5) all act as wait gates: we fire only when the
// GPU is free *and* either the cohort is full or the safety bound
// has elapsed.
//
// **Why the cohort cap is load-bearing.** In iteration-level
// batching, `pinned_count(device)` is the count of currently-active
// contexts on that device. After a batch fires, every one of those
// contexts will eventually submit its next forward-pass request.
// Once we have all of them in the accumulator (`B == pinned_count`),
// waiting longer can't produce a bigger batch from existing peers —
// it can only catch brand-new contexts that pin during the wait. At
// realistic Poisson arrival rates that's rarely worth one extra
// batch's worth of delay for the existing peers. So: fire.
//
// `pinned_count` over-counts if a peer's inferlet is mid-CPU-work
// (pinned but not currently submitting). The safety bound is the
// fallback for that case.
//
// **Why the GPU-busy gate (vs `EagerPolicy`).** Without the gate,
// the cohort-full condition can fire while the previous batch is
// still on the device. The scheduler then enters its `Fire` branch
// and blocks on `acquire_owned().await` for the in-flight permit.
// During that block the scheduler stops draining the request
// channel, so any arrivals queued during that window fall into the
// *next* batch. With the gate, the policy stays in `Wait` until the
// GPU is free; the scheduler's `tokio::select` keeps absorbing
// arrivals into the *current* batch right up to the moment of fire.
//
// **Why `last_latency` (not `ref_l` with smoothing).** The original
// policy used a leaky-max of recent batch latencies. The smoothing
// served two purposes: (a) damping spikes, (b) preventing a death
// spiral where a single small batch shrinks the budget so far that
// all subsequent batches are also small. With the cohort cap as the
// primary fire mechanism, neither problem materializes:
//
//   - The bound only fires when `B < pinned_count` — i.e., when
//     peers are stuck. In that regime, firing fast IS correct;
//     there's nothing to wait for.
//   - When the bound *does* fire, the resulting batch's actual
//     decode time becomes the next `last_latency`. The value
//     re-calibrates within 1–2 batches.
//
// Empirically validated under: steady RPS sweeps {1,4,16,64},
// symmetric churn (32↔1), severe idle↔burst churn (0.5↔64), and
// rapid 2-second bursts. No spiral or runaway observed.
