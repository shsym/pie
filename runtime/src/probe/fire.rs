//! Per-fire scheduler lifecycle probes.
//!
//! Gated by the `profile-fire` Cargo feature. With the feature off,
//! the `probe_fire!` macro expands to a body-only no-op (no
//! `Instant::now()`, no `fetch_add`) — the holder structs and atomics
//! are still defined so callers and readers compile, but probe sites
//! produce no code.
//!
//! ## Hierarchy
//!
//! ```text
//! FireProbes
//! ├── inter_fire_us            sibling — gap between consecutive fire starts
//! ├── post_dispatch_to_fire_us sibling — gap from dispatch end to next fire
//! ├── last_fire_spawn_micros   timestamp (always-on, cheap)
//! ├── last_dispatch_end_micros timestamp (always-on, cheap)
//! ├── accumulate.*             before-fire host work
//! ├── pre_dispatch.*           between fire-decision and execute
//! ├── execute.*                the hot path; children sum to total_us
//! └── post_dispatch.*          after-execute host work
//! ```
//!
//! **Invariant**: `execute.total_us` should equal the sum of its
//! children (`batch_build_us + driver_fire_us + response_dispatch_us`)
//! within ~5 µs of probe overhead. If they diverge meaningfully, there
//! is unaccounted work *inside* `execute` that needs its own probe.
//!
//! **Sibling vs nested**: `inter_fire_us` and `post_dispatch_to_fire_us`
//! are NOT contained in any `execute.*` probe — they measure gaps
//! *between* fires, not work done during a fire. Don't sum them with
//! children of `execute`.
