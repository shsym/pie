//! Stage 3 hard gate: the declared forward is token-identical to the
//! hand-written one, on the same GPU, the same fire, the same reduction
//! order.
//!
//! The `PIE_DECLARED_FORWARD` gate is shell-controlled, so the harness runs
//! this twice — gate-OFF (hand-written `llama_like_forward_paged`) then
//! gate-ON (`llama_like_forward_declared` walking the traced form) — and the
//! parity claim is the two token vectors being byte-identical, compared
//! through a cross-invocation record file (the `cuda_mtp_stage1` idiom).
//!
//! Two disciplines make the exact-match bar legitimate here where
//! `cuda_contention` correctly refuses it:
//! * single request — co-batched decode is not batch-invariant (bf16
//!   reduction order flips argmax near ties; `cuda_contention.rs`), so the
//!   comparison never mixes batch compositions;
//! * both invocations run the full fast-path vocabulary, fused decode
//!   postprocess included. The v0 harness pinned
//!   `PIE_CUDA_DECODE_FUSED_POST=0` on both sides because the declared
//!   executor spoke only the hand-written UNFUSED path and the fused
//!   postprocess rounds differently; the executor now carries the fused
//!   decode-QKV peephole (declared_forward.cpp), and this file's DELETION
//!   of that override is the proof the peephole matched — parity now holds
//!   with both sides fused, under the environment's default gates.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, driver-cuda. Run both polarities; the second invocation
//! gates. Since cutover step 4(a) the DEFAULT is the declared executor,
//! so the disarmed run is the one that needs the env:
//!   cargo test -p pie-gpu-tests --no-default-features --features driver-cuda \
//!     --test cuda_declared_forward_parity -- --ignored --nocapture
//!   PIE_DECLARED_FORWARD=0 cargo test ... --test cuda_declared_forward_parity ...
