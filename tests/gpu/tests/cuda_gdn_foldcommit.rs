//! **fold-commit on the REAL linear model** — drives the `gdn-foldcommit`
//! inferlet on Qwen3.5-0.8B (GDN backbone) so the buffer/fold machinery is
//! exercised against real weights rather than the mock model in
//! `runtime/engine/tests/rs_frame.rs`.
//!
//! `rs_frame.rs` proves the HOST bookkeeping (slot accounting, CSR shapes,
//! refusals). It cannot prove the driver actually replays buffered
//! activations, because its model computes nothing. Everything about the
//! recurrent read path lives on the far side of that boundary, so it needs a
//! GPU test.
//!
//! Two cases, and the split is the point:
//!
//!  - `one_chunk_folds_from_the_buffer` — buffer one chunk, fold a prefix of
//!    it. This is the position the driver supports today.
//!  - `two_chunks_need_the_buffer_read_path` — buffer a chunk, fold PART of
//!    it, then buffer a SECOND chunk onto the surviving tail. The second
//!    append starts from a non-empty buffer, so its recurrence would have to
//!    begin at `folded ⊕ replay(buffer)`. The runtime refuses it today
//!    (`pipeline::fire::rs_plan_for`) and this test PINS that refusal: it is
//!    the acceptance test for the read path, and it flips from "refused for
//!    the right reason" to "runs and is correct" when the read path lands.
//!
