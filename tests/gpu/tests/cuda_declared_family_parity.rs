//! The declared drive is token-identical to the hand-written pass, for
//! the families whose gate is still opt-in: gemma-4 and gpt-oss.
//!
//! `cuda_declared_forward_parity` is the same claim for llama_like, and
//! this file differs from it in one way that matters. That harness
//! compares ONE sampled stream across the two invocations, which is
//! legitimate for qwen-3-0.6b because a single-request fire there is
//! reproducible. It is NOT legitimate here:
//!
//! * gpt-oss's first run after boot answered one seed differently from
//!   its next five, on BOTH sides of the gate — a warm-up artifact of
//!   the hand-written pass that the declared drive faithfully
//!   reproduces. A one-sample harness comparing run 1 against run 2
//!   would have failed a correct drive;
//! * gemma-4 through a chat inferlet flips a tail token between runs of
//!   one process, so a single sample is not even self-consistent.
//!
//! So each side is sampled `SAMPLES` times and the claim is that the two
//! SEQUENCES match — the distribution including its quirks, which is a
//! strictly stronger statement than one sample and the only one these
//! deployments can support. A drive that agreed on the steady state but
//! not on the warm-up would fail here, and should.
//!
//! Both observations above come from ad-hoc harnesses, not from this
//! one: on the runs that landed this file every sample was stable on
//! both sides for both families. The sampling is insurance against a
//! flake that has been seen rather than a reproduction of one, and it
//! costs three extra 48-token generations against a model that is
//! already booted.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, driver-cuda, and each family needs its checkpoint in the
//! HF cache. Run both polarities; the second invocation gates:
//!
//! ```text
//!   cargo test -p pie-gpu-tests --release --no-default-features \
//!     --features driver-cuda --test cuda_declared_family_parity \
//!     -- --ignored --nocapture
//!   PIE_DECLARED_FORWARD_GEMMA4=0 cargo test ... gemma4 ...   (gemma-4 defaults ON)
//!   PIE_DECLARED_FORWARD_GPT_OSS=1 cargo test ... gpt_oss ...   (gpt-oss is opt-in)
//! ```
