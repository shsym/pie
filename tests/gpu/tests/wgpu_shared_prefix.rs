//! Two conversations that begin with the same words.
//!
//! `wgpu_many_conversations` proves eight histories stay apart when they have
//! nothing in common. This asks the harder version: the same driver, over
//! prompts whose first several PAGES are identical token for token, which is
//! the input a prefix cache exists to collapse.
//!
//! It is the last entry of `driver-wgpu`'s `tests/rules.rs` `NO_TWIN` list
//! that said nothing covered it. The driver half was proved --
//! `a_forked_seat_reads_the_history_it_was_given` and
//! `a_two_level_prefix_tree_reads_what_a_seat_that_never_forked_reads` in
//! `crates/driver-wgpu/tests/serving.rs` -- but nothing ran two conversations
//! with a shared preamble through the edge where the ENGINE decides what to
//! share.
//!
//! # What was measured, and what is therefore not yet asserted
//!
//! The engine can share pages structurally -- `KvStore::adopt_cached_prefix`
//! grafts a cached prefix into an empty working set and writes CoW off it --
//! but the probe that would CALL it, `pipeline::fire::kv::match_prefix`, is
//! not wired into the live path, and its own doc says so. So on this build the
//! second conversation recomputes the preamble into pages of its own, and no
//! fire this test produces names one page twice.
//!
//! Worth writing down rather than assuming, because of what happens when the
//! wiring lands -- and because the answer differs between the two ports.
//!
//! `driver-vulkan`'s gate warns that its `Frame::of` will then refuse a
//! CORRECT plan: it refuses any frame naming one page twice, and a grafted
//! prefix is read by both requests and written by neither. Its `Unstageable`
//! doc names the fix -- compare WRITE pages -- and has not made it.
//!
//! **This port already made it.** `driver-wgpu/src/resources.rs`'s loop skips
//! any row that states an explicit write slot before it asks who owns the
//! page, so
//! `Unstageable::SharedPage` fires only when two requests would APPEND into
//! one page, which is the corruption the many-conversations gate is about.
//! The narrowing was not foresight about prefix caches: beam search forced it,
//! because a beam's lanes are separate requests of one conversation that share
//! every page of the prefix they forked from, and the wider rule refused them
//! before they could state what they wanted. The doc on `SharedPage` records
//! that, and this gate is what keeps the rule narrow.
//!
//! # What it does assert today
//!
//! That a long identical preamble does not make two conversations answer each
//! other. Each is asked twice -- once alone, so the second launch has a warm
//! prefix to match if matching ever begins, and once with both in flight --
//! and each has a one-word answer the other cannot produce. It is the
//! many-conversation gate's claim over the input most likely to break it, and
//! it is the gate that turns red rather than quiet when sharing arrives.
//!
//! ```text
//! PIE_HOME=/tmp/piehome cargo test -p pie-gpu-tests --features driver-wgpu \
//!   --test wgpu_shared_prefix -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! One boot per process, so this is its own test binary.

     the family name last. Quantities smaller than one are written with a leading zero, and \
     quantities larger than a thousand are written with a separator every three digits. \
     Anything uncertain is marked with a question mark in the margin rather than guessed at, \
     and anything corrected is struck through rather than erased, so that the older reading \
     stays legible. The sheet is copied out by hand once a month, which is slow, but the \
     copying is how the rules are remembered. After the general rules come the specific \
     notes, and the specific notes are what I actually look up. They are grouped by subject, \
