"""From what context does Quest pay for itself?

Quest trades work for work. It spends time it did not have to spend -- an
`envelope_dot` per layer, a top-k, a page-table compaction -- to make the
attention read fewer pages. Below some context the overhead is larger than the
saving and the feature is a net loss; above it, a win. That crossover is the
only number that decides whether to turn Quest on, and it is not derivable from
kernel microbenchmarks, because the overhead is per-layer-per-step while the
saving is proportional to the context that the budget removes.

Method. Wall-clock decode cost is measured by DIFFERENCING two runs that differ
only in `max_tokens`:

    ms_per_token = (t(long) - t(short)) / (long - short)

which cancels prefill, WASM instantiation, server round-trips and process
warm-up -- everything that does not scale with the number of decode steps.
Every configuration is run `reps` times and the MINIMUM is kept: this host is
shared, so a mean measures the neighbours, while the minimum measures the work.
