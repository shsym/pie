"""Smoke tests for the curated inference-time inferlets.

Native MTP is build-validated separately because the default test model does
not expose multi-token-prediction heads.

The inference-time-algorithm inferlets each report the statistic that proves
their rule fired, so these assert on that statistic rather than on the decoded
text, which is model- and seed-dependent. Two of them additionally get an
identity control: at the parameter value where the algorithm reduces to plain
sampling, the reported divergence must be exactly zero.
