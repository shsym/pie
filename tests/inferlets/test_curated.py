"""Smoke tests for the curated inference-time inferlets.

Native MTP is build-validated separately because the default test model does
not expose multi-token-prediction heads.

The inference-time-algorithm inferlets each report the statistic that proves
their rule fired, so these assert on that statistic rather than on the decoded
text, which is model- and seed-dependent. Two of them additionally get an
identity control: at the parameter value where the algorithm reduces to plain
sampling, the reported divergence must be exactly zero.

    """M-1(b): a deterministic, sensible caption on a real image, e2e.

    Three assertions, and they are three different strengths of claim.

    1. **SENSIBLE** -- the caption names the colour. This is the weakest of the
       three and the one that is about the MODEL: a 0.8-billion-parameter
       trunk describing a flat colour field is not a hard vision task, but it
       is still a model's taste, and a checkpoint that answered "a solid block
       of colour" would fail this while being perfectly correct. That is the
       honest limit of "sensible" here, and it is why the image is a solid
       square rather than a photograph: it is the one picture whose content is
       a sentence this file can state.

    2. **DETERMINISTIC** -- greedy decoding, so the same image and the same
       prompt answer the same tokens twice. This is about the ENGINE: a patch
       payload staged into a slot the previous fire left dirty, or a route
       computed off a stale offset, shows up here as a caption that moves.

    3. **THE TOWER CONDITIONED THE TRUNK** -- a red square and a blue square
       answer DIFFERENTLY. This is the claim that holds whatever the model's
       taste is, and it is the one that catches the failure the whole door
       exists to prevent: a pass that scattered nothing, or scattered into the
       wrong rows, answers fluently about an image it never saw -- and answers
       the same fluent thing for every image.
