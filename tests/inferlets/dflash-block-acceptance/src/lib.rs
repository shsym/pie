//! **HOW MUCH OF A DFLASH BLOCK THE TARGET ACTUALLY KEEPS.**
//!
//! A block drafter proposes `block` tokens in ONE pass over
//! `[anchor, MASK x block-1]`, and a speculative round keeps the longest
//! PREFIX of them the target agrees with. That prefix is the whole economics
//! of the technique — it is what multiplies a verify fire's cost into
//! tokens — and it cannot be read from the engine's own harness, because a
//! host readout seat hands back one row per lane and a truncated block is
//! not a window onto the full one (a block DIFFUSION model trained at one
//! width is out of distribution at every other; see
//! `engine-metal/tests/the_block_drafters_proposals_are_measured.rs`).
//!
//! So it is measured here, where an epilogue can read all `block` proposals
//! off the `mtp.drafts` seam on the device:
//!
//! ```text
//! draft   [anchor, MASK x block-1]   one pass, `set-drafting-block`, block mask
//!         -> mtp.drafts              `block` proposals, one a row
//! truth   the target's own next `block` tokens, decoded greedily
//! kept    |longest prefix where proposal_i == truth_i|
//! ```
//!
//! # Which head, of the three that ship
//!
//! `scratchpad/dflash_ref/heads.py` runs all three through ONE runtime
//! (`mlx_dspark`, which carries both DFlash architectures and DSpark's),
//! each against ITS OWN target, and keeps EVERY round's accepted prefix
//! rather than its mean. The index beside each cell is tokens a round over
//! fires a round at the width that prices it best, against this box's fire
//! staircase (`a_fire_is_priced_by_its_width`, one row = 66.54 ms: 1.04 /
//! 1.16 / 1.43 / 1.77 / 1.83 / 2.78 at 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 16 rows, plus
//! 0.27 for the draft fire — the same constant for every head). 192 tokens
//! a prompt, greedy, chat template:
//!
//! ```text
//!          block   counting        code        recall       prose        json     mean
//! DFlash     16  4.24 w8 2.21  6.66 w8 2.82  2.95 w3 1.97  3.34 w4 1.96  6.09 w8 2.70  2.33
//! DFlash2     8  6.62 w8 3.32  5.08 w8 2.72  3.78 w8 2.22  2.85 w3 1.90  5.19 w8 2.75  2.58
//! DSpark     16  8.29 w16 2.94 5.18 w8 2.44  2.98 w3 1.88  2.37 w3 1.86  5.05 w8 2.36  2.29
//! ```
//!
//! **THE EARLIER TABLE HERE PINNED THE WIDTH, AND THAT DECIDED IT.** It read
//! DFlash 2.69 against DFlash2 2.76 — a tie — by pricing DFlash at sixteen
//! rows and DFlash2 at its native eight, which hands one head the cheaper
//! rung; and it reported DFlash2's prose as 0.93, "a round that loses to
//! plain decode". Neither survives. `E[min(kept + 1, w)]` is not a function
//! of `E[kept]`, so a mean cannot be re-priced at another width — the
//! distribution has to be kept, and once it is, **no head loses on any
//! workload**: the smallest cell above is 1.86.
//!
//! **DFlash2 leads, by 11% on the mean**, and DSpark is NOT the outlier the
//! old note made it (it read "an index of about 1.4" from published means at
//! width-sixteen prices; measured here it is 2.29, within 2% of DFlash).
//! What the old note got right is the shape: DFlash2's shorter block is
//! stronger where prefixes are short (counting 3.32, recall 2.22) and DFlash
//! is stronger on code (2.82).
//!
//! **But the width matters more than the head.** DFlash pinned at sixteen
//! means 1.84 and at its per-prompt best 2.33 — 27% — where the whole spread
//! between the three heads is 2.29 to 2.58, 12%. Pinned means for the record:
//! DFlash w4 2.06 / w8 2.29 / w16 1.84, DFlash2 w4 2.10 / w8 2.56, DSpark
//! w4 1.99 / w8 2.19.
//!
//! **The confound that cannot be removed**: DFlash runs on Qwen3.6-27B and
//! the other two on Qwen3.8-27B, because that is what each was trained
//! against — and a head off its own target is not a control but a different
//! measurement (the old note measured that too: DFlash on the 3.8 checkpoint
//! loses half its counting prefix). So the 11% is a head-and-target
//! difference, and porting DFlash2 would also mean porting to a new target.
//!
//! This measures; it does not go fast. Each round pays one draft pass and
//! `block` ordinary decodes, and the host is in the loop between them — the
//! point is the number, not the throughput. A round that turned the same
//! machinery into speed would verify the block in ONE fire instead of
//! decoding it, which is the loop `rs-mtp-speculative-decoding` runs for the
//! chained heads.
