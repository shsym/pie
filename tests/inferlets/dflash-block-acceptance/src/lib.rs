//! **HOW MUCH OF A DFLASH BLOCK THE TARGET ACTUALLY KEEPS.**
//!
//! A block drafter proposes `block` tokens in ONE pass over
//! `[anchor, MASK x block-1]`, and a speculative round keeps the longest
//! PREFIX of them the target agrees with. That prefix is the whole economics
//! of the technique — it is what multiplies a verify fire's cost into
//! tokens — and it cannot be read from the engine's own harness, because a
//! host readout seat hands back one row per lane and a truncated block is
//! not a window onto the full one (a block DIFFUSION model trained at one
//! width is out of distribution at every other; see
//! `engine-metal/tests/the_block_drafters_proposals_are_measured.rs`).
//!
//! So it is measured here, where an epilogue can read all `block` proposals
//! off the `mtp.drafts` seam on the device:
//!
//! ```text
//! draft   [anchor, MASK x block-1]   one pass, `set-drafting-block`, block mask
//!         -> mtp.drafts              `block` proposals, one a row
//! truth   the target's own next `block` tokens, decoded greedily
//! kept    |longest prefix where proposal_i == truth_i|
//! ```
//!
//! # Which head, of the three that ship
//!
//! `scratchpad/dflash_ref/compare_heads.py` runs each published head against
//! ITS OWN target, twelve anchors a prompt, and reports the accepted prefix
//! with the round's index beside it — tokens a round over fires a round, at
//! this box's width prices (a verify fire is 1.83 one-row fires at eight rows
//! and 2.82 at sixteen; the draft fire adds 0.27 at sixteen):
//!
//! ```text
//!                     counting      code        recall      prose       json
//! DFlash   b=16   13.58(4.72)  8.00(2.91)  1.25(0.73)  9.92(3.53)  3.83(1.56)
//! DFlash2  b= 8    7.00(4.07)  6.92(4.03)  4.00(2.54)  0.83(0.93)  3.42(2.25)
//! ```
//!
//! It is a TIE on the mean index (2.69 against 2.76) with opposite profiles:
//! the shorter block saturates where prefixes are short and cannot pay where
//! they are long — prose at 0.93 is a round that loses to plain decode. So
//! DFlash2's grouped dynamic convolutions and its candidate selector are not
//! bought by these numbers, and the head already ported stays.
//!
//! **A HEAD IS TIED TO THE TARGET IT WAS TRAINED ON**, which is the control
//! that makes the table above readable: the same DFlash head against the 3.8
//! checkpoint instead of its own 3.6 reads 3.92 / 5.33 / 2.08 / 0.67 / 1.75 —
//! counting falls from 13.58 and prose from 9.92. Two checkpoints that a
//! catalog row cannot tell apart are not interchangeable to a drafter.
//!
//! Dspark (`DimInfer/Qwen3.8-27B-Dspark-v1`, block 15, a markov confidence
//! head) ships no modeling code, only weights and GGUFs, and publishes
//! 1.69x-2.51x on a 4090D at a mean accepted length of 2.7-4.1. That length
//! against THIS box's width curve is an index of about 1.4, under both heads
//! above: its speedup is a property of a GPU where sixteen rows cost two
//! one-row fires rather than 2.82.
//!
//! This measures; it does not go fast. Each round pays one draft pass and
//! `block` ordinary decodes, and the host is in the loop between them — the
//! point is the number, not the throughput. A round that turned the same
//! machinery into speed would verify the block in ONE fire instead of
//! decoding it, which is the loop `rs-mtp-speculative-decoding` runs for the
//! chained heads.
