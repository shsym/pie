"""The commands a person types to get a picture out of pie, in the order they type them.

This is the USER PATH, not the sampler. `test_text_to_image.py` is the gate on
the guest -- that it finds its readings by role, steps the family's own sigmas,
refuses a model with no text encoder. This one asserts the half in front of
that: that the facts are visible before the run, that the run needs no path,
and that what comes back is a named file a decoder turns into a picture of the
size that was asked for.

Three claims, in the order the guide teaches them:

  * `pie model list` / `pie model info` report the served row's GENERATIVE
    facts -- its readings, its latent space, its schedule -- off the catalog,
    without opening a tensor;
  * `pie run text-to-image -o DIR -- --prompt "..."` runs the guest BY NAME.
    No `--path`, no `--manifest`: the name resolves against the
    `tests/inferlets` of the checkout the command runs in;
  * the file that arrives is NAMED -- `image.png` where the row drives its own
    `vae.decode` reading, `image.latent.f32` where it does not, never
    `file-0000.bin` -- and it is a PNG of the size that was asked for, either
    straight out of the run or through `scripts/imagegen/decode_latent.py`.

**WHAT THE PICTURE CHECK DOES NOT PROVE.** It proves the file decodes, that it
is the size that was asked for, and that the decode was not a flat field. It
does NOT prove the trajectory was right, and that limit was measured rather
than assumed: a run whose denoise loop went wrong decodes to a textured field
whose colour count, local gradient and contrast are indistinguishable from a
photograph's (11.9 vs 11.9 mean horizontal gradient over the two observed on
2026-09-06). Separating those needs a reference, which this suite does not
carry. A person looking at the PNG is still the check on fidelity.

**WANTS A GENERATIVE MODEL.** A config bound to a text row has nothing to
drive here and is reported as a skip, not a failure:

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 uv run python tests/inferlets/test_generating_images.py \\
        --config ~/.pie/config.t2i-client.toml \\
        --model-dir ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--black-forest-labs--FLUX.2-klein-4B/snapshots/*/

**GIVE THIS RUN ITS OWN CONFIG FILE**, with its own `[server] port` and
`[engine] max_model_len = 32768`. A shared config another process repoints at
a different artifact mid-run is indistinguishable from a numerics regression:
the run still succeeds and hands back a plausible latent for the wrong model.
The `max_model_len` default of 4096 kills a 1024**2 job on its second fire
("this fire wants 8192 kv tokens in one slot").

**THE SUBMIT DEADLINE IS NOT A KNOB THIS SUITE TOUCHES**, and it used to be.
A denoise frame composes an attention group out of the image lane and the
context lane, and the group forms only when both are members of ONE step; that
wait was once leashed by `[runtime] submit_deadline` (50 ms), and a 1024**2
job's first submit carries megabytes of seeded `context` and `latents` across
the guest boundary, so under load the leash fired first and the frame sealed
with the IMAGE LANE ALONE -- an unconditioned denoise, reported as a success,
decoding to exactly the textured field the note above says this suite cannot
tell from a photograph. Measured on FLUX.2-klein-4B on 2026-09-06, 4 steps at
1024**2, one prompt and seed, one GPU with no neighbours:

    50 ms, before the fix   1 of 3 correct eager, 4 of 5 bodied, and the wrong
                            ones bit-identical to each other per trajectory --
                            a race, which reads exactly like a numerics
                            non-determinism and is not one. `graphs = "off"`
                            made it WORSE, not better, because the eager text
                            fire is slower and misses the leash more often.
    50 ms, after the fix    4 of 4 bit-identical and correct.

The runtime now keeps the promise instead: a stated cohort fires whole or not
at all (`crates/runtime/src/scheduler/frame.rs`, `group_short`). So this suite
runs at the default -- if a partial group is ever sealed again, a run of this
that comes back as a textured field is one of the things that says so.

The PNG needs an interpreter with torch + diffusers (`--python`); without
`--model-dir` the run proves the loop and the file name and says so.
