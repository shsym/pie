//! **A BLOCK DRAFTER'S SPECULATIVE LOOP: ONE DRAFT FIRE, ONE VERIFY FIRE.**
//!
//! `dflash-block-acceptance` measures how much of a block the target keeps
//! and pays `block` ordinary decodes to learn it. This spends that number:
//! a round is TWO fires, and it emits every token the target agreed with
//! plus the one it corrected.
//!
//! ```text
//! draft    [anchor, MASK x block-1]      one fire, `set-drafting-block`
//!          -> d[0..block-1]              row i proposes position held+i
//! verify   [anchor, d[0], .., d[b-2]]    one fire, the TRUNK, plainly causal
//!          -> t[i] = argmax(row i)       the target's own token for held+i+1
//! keep     the longest prefix where d[j] == t[j], then t at the break
//! ```
//!
//! The break's token is the target's, so a round emits `kept + 1` tokens and
//! is never wrong: the sequence this writes is the sequence a one-token-a-
//! fire decode would have written. That is the whole claim a speculative
//! loop makes, and `--baseline` runs the other loop over the same prompt so
//! the ratio is measured rather than argued.
//!
//! # What it measured
//!
//! `qwen36-27b-dflash` on an M4 Pro, greedy, the same 192 tokens either way
//! (a 64-token run subtracted from a 256-token one, so the load is out of
//! the number) and the two roads token for token identical:
//!
//! ```text
//! counting  "1, 2, 3, ..."     14.00 tok/round   62.1 tok/s   vs 15.0   4.1x
//! code      "write a function" 6.14 tok/round    28.4 tok/s   vs 15.1   1.9x
//! ```
//!
//! # THOSE ARE RAW CONTINUATIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT SERVING NUMBERS
//!
//! The two lines above were measured before this file took
//! `text-completion-bench`'s envelope: no chat template, no system prompt,
//! the prompt handed to the model as raw text to continue. A served request
//! is templated, and the model then answers a QUESTION rather than
//! continuing a pattern — which is a different distribution and the drafter
//! feels it. Through `benches/pie_bench.py latency` (4 requests x 256
//! tokens, `--ignore-eos`, the same knobs the three-way uses), one arm
//! against the other on this box:
//!
//! ```text
//!                                      base    spec    ratio   tok/round
//! "Write a short story about a robot"  14.52   15.39   1.06x     3.21
//! "Write a Python function that ..."   14.58   23.95   1.64x     5.80
//! "Count from 1 to 200, ..."           14.32   21.10   1.47x     7.08
//! "List the capitals of every ..."     14.65   12.96   0.88x     2.88
//! ```
//!
//! **THE LAST ROW IS A LOSS, AND IT IS THE POINT.** A round costs roughly
//! three one-row decodes — a sixteen-row verify fire is 2.79 of them on this
//! box, and the five-layer draft fire through the target's `lm_head` is the
//! rest — so the loop pays only above about THREE TOKENS A ROUND. Prose sits
//! at 3.21 and is a wash; a list of capitals sits at 2.88 and is worse than
//! decoding one token a fire. The block width does not fix this (see the
//! staircase below): the fix is a drafter that accepts more, or a guest that
//! notices its own tokens-a-round and stops speculating. **The engine must
//! not make that call** — which rounds are worth a fire is the inferlet's.
//!
//! At 64 tokens a request the same pairs read 13.53/15.15 (1.12x),
//! 13.44/22.39 (1.67x) and 13.41/17.62 (1.31x): the ratio is set by content,
//! not by how long the answer runs.
//!
//! # THE FULL BLOCK IS THE WORST WIDTH THERE IS
//!
//! The drafter proposes fifteen and the loop verified all sixteen rows,
//! which is what every number above was taken at. Swept through
//! `benches/pie_bench.py latency --requests 4 --max-tokens 256`, that is
//! the worst choice available on all four workloads:
//!
//! ```text
//!              w=16     w=4      w=8      auto
//! prose        1.06x    1.41x    1.27x    1.29x
//! code         1.62x    1.62x    1.90x    1.80x
//! capitals     0.93x    1.30x    1.19x    1.16x
//! counting     1.47x    1.51x    1.83x    1.89x
//! mean         1.27     1.46     1.55     1.54
//! ```
//!
//! **And no fixed width dominates either**: four wins prose and the list,
//! eight wins code, and on counting the ladder beats every fixed width there
//! is (1.89x) because it climbs to sixteen once the target starts taking
//! whole windows. `auto_width` is therefore the default — it costs about 8%
//! against knowing the right width in advance (prose 1.29x where a pinned
//! four reads 1.41x) and never picks the width that loses. Pin one with
//! `verify_rows` to reproduce a row of the table.
//!
//! Why sixteen loses is the staircase and the censoring together: a
//! sixteen-row fire costs 2.79 one-row decodes and prose only ever keeps
//! about 2.8 tokens, so twelve of those rows are bought and thrown away
//! every round.
//!
//! # What the rungs cost, and the two hypotheses the numbers refused
//!
//! `a_quantized_matmul_is_priced_by_its_rows` on this box (K=5120 N=17408,
//! 4-bit, one projection, us a launch — reproducible to 2% run to run):
//!
//! ```text
//!   rows      1      2      3      4      5      6      8
//!   us      208    206    227    285    348    349    349
//!   x1row  1.00   0.99   1.09   1.37   1.67   1.68   1.68
//!   GB/s    214    217    196    157    128    128    128
//! ```
//!
//! **Two rows are FREE and five through eight cost the same**, which is why
//! the ladder's rungs are what they are: below five the vector fold answers,
//! from five the tile does and it is flat to eight, so a width in 5..8 should
//! always be eight.
//!
//! Two things were tried against the four-row step and did not move it.
//! **Pack width**: `qmv_rows_packs` 1 against 2 reads 285.9 against 293.3 us
//! at four rows — inside the drift, so the 64 floats a thread holds there are
//! not costing occupancy the way the shape suggested. **A three-row rung**:
//! three rows cost 1.09x where four cost 1.37x, so a workload keeping under
//! three tokens should prefer it — measured on prose, `verify_rows` 2/3/4
//! reads 1.22x / 1.49x / **1.53x**, and four still wins. The extra token a
//! round is worth more than the step it climbs. Neither is in the ladder.
//!
//! # The waste is paid TWICE, and the draft fire pays it too
//!
//! A block drafter has no head of its own — its rows go through the TARGET's
//! `lm_head`, the widest matrix in the model — so a draft fire that reads out
//! all sixteen rows to then verify four buys twelve rows of that head and
//! throws them away, exactly as the verify side did. The width is known
//! BEFORE the draft whenever it comes from the ladder or from `verify_rows`
//! (only `margin_width` picks it after, off margins the readout would not
//! then contain), so the readout narrows with it. Measured, same shape:
//!
//! ```text
//!              readout 16   readout = width
//! prose          1.29x          1.38x
//! code           1.80x          1.82x
//! capitals       1.16x          1.32x
//! counting       1.89x          1.88x
//! ```
//!
//! **The gain tracks how narrow the width got** — prose and the list run at
//! four rows and gain 7% and 14%, counting runs at sixteen and gains nothing,
//! which is the same arithmetic read from the other end.
//!
//! # What the ladder still costs against knowing the answer
//!
//! Back to back in one session on prose: `auto` 1.40x and 1.47x, a pinned
//! four 1.57x. The ladder spends 88 of 93 rounds at four — so the ~9% is
//! the OTHER five: a round at eight or sixteen costs 1.7-2.7x one at four,
//! and 5% of rounds at 2x is 5% of the run. Tightening the climb would take
//! it back and lose counting, which is the row where the ladder beats every
//! fixed width (1.88x against a pinned eight's 1.83x) precisely BECAUSE it
//! excurses. The trade is stated rather than resolved; `verify_rows` pins a
//! width for a caller who knows its workload.
//!
//! # AT EIGHT CONCURRENT THE LOOP LOSES, AND IT IS NOT THE DRAFTER
//!
//! `tput --num-requests 32 --concurrency 8 --max-tokens 64`, dflash SKU:
//!
//! ```text
//! text-completion-bench, mtp SKU      47.67 tok/s
//! text-completion-bench, dflash SKU   46.27          the ctx arm costs 3%
//! this loop, --baseline               23.52          the STRUCTURE costs 49%
//! this loop, auto width               18.32   0.78x
//! ```
//!
//! **The drafter's context arm is nearly free even at concurrency** — three
//! percent against the plain SKU through the same plain inferlet — so the
//! half that is missing is this loop's own shape: it awaits a host readback
//! every round, and a wave waits on its straggler lane, so eight
//! host-in-the-loop guests each put a turnaround on the critical path.
//! `text-completion-bench` runs ahead instead and never lands one there.
//!
//! Sizing the take-side rings the way that file and `mtp-speculative-bench`
//! size theirs was tried and moved NOTHING (23.52 against 23.44): those
//! loops hoist their channels out of the round and this one builds them
//! fresh, and the ticket check is not what is binding.
//!
//! # WHAT A DEVICE-RESIDENT ROUND WOULD NEED, AND IT IS ALREADY THERE
//!
//! `rs-mtp-speculative-bench` is the proof: a speculative loop on a model
//! with a recurrence, device-resident, and it **never calls
//! `discard_buffered` at all**. It allocates `2 * run_pages` once — "two runs
//! of one window each: the runtime alternates them per fire" — binds
//! `buffer: 0..run_pages`, and writes its fold length from the fire's OWN
//! epilogue (`fold_len.put(&(&m + &one))`, where `m` is the accepted prefix
//! computed as `reduce_sum(cumprod(eq(proposed, said)))`). The rejected rows
//! are overwritten by the next round rather than forgotten by a host call,
//! and the runtime carries the device length through
//! `RS_FLAG_FOLD_LEN_DEVICE` (`store/rs/write.rs::mark_fold_len_device`).
//!
//! So the rest of that round is expressible too: the committed tokens and
//! the next window's `positions`, `kv_len`, `w_slot`, `w_off` and pages come
//! out of `select`/`gather` into the channels the next fire reads, and
//! `run_ahead` keeps the runtime's window full while the host drains text.
//!
//! **What is left is this file's shape, not the engine's contract.** Two
//! things: a round here is TWO fires (a masked draft over the drafter, then
//! the trunk's verify) where the mtp loop fuses its head into one, and
//! `run_ahead` submits ONE repeated pass — `submit_frame` takes a slot per
//! wave, so a `[draft, verify]` frame is expressible, but driving it needs a
//! pipelined submit loop of this file's own rather than `run_ahead`. And the
//! draft's proposals have to reach the verify's `embed` through a channel
//! instead of through the host. Both are guest work in this file.
//!
//! Until that rewrite the loop is host-in-the-loop and the eight-concurrent
//! row above is what it costs.
//!
//! # The gate, and what it costs to never lose
//!
//! `min_tokens_per_round` (see `Gate`) is the guest reading its OWN yield
//! and declining to draft when it is under water. A gated round is the same
//! verify fire at ONE row, so it carries the pending fold and buffers its
//! own row exactly as a wide one does — nothing about the fold-commit
//! contract changes. Proven rather than argued: with the floor set high
//! enough that the gate never opens, 128 tokens of the code prompt come back
//! TOKEN FOR TOKEN identical to `--baseline`.
//!
//! Swept on this box, same four-request 256-token shape, `tok/s` against a
//! `--baseline` arm of 14.52 (prose) / 14.58 (code) / 14.65 (capitals):
//!
//! ```text
//! floor      capitals        code          prose
//! off      12.96  0.88x   23.95  1.64x   15.39  1.06x
//! 2.5      14.79  1.01x   22.57  1.55x

//!          14.74  1.01x   22.91  1.57x   15.71  1.08x
//! ```
//!
//! **The last row is the setting this file ships**, and the trade it makes
//! is stated plainly: the loss row goes to parity and prose gains a little,
//! and the workload where drafting wins most pays 4% for it (1.64x -> 1.57x).
//! A floor ABOVE break-even is worse on both ends — 3.5 closes on code often
//! enough to cost 13% and still lands capitals under 1.0x, because a window
//! that dips is not a workload that changed. Left at zero the gate never
//! closes, which is the loop every number above this section was taken with.
//!
//! # The prices are measured, and the gate reads them
//!
//! Every constant above — the staircase, the three rungs, break-even near
//! three tokens a round — is ONE trunk's on ONE box, and the first mixture
//! this loop was pointed at broke all of them: gemma-4-26B-A4B prices a
//! verify fire by the EXPERTS its rows touch, so 4 / 8 / 16 rows cost 1.7 /
//! 2.5 / 4.6 one-row fires (28 / 41 / 69 ms against 14) and the draft fire
//! alone costs 0.65 of a decode (9 ms). The stated ladder ran prose at 0.76x
//! of plain decode. So `priced` (ON by default) times every fire on the
//! guest's clock — submit to readback, what the guest waits — keeps a median
//! a shape (`Prices`), estimates the yield at each rung from the recent
//! rounds' per-position hit rates (`Gate::expect`, which reads a censored
//! round as censored), and buys the rung with the best tokens per price, or
//! a plain fire when none beats one token a fire (`Gate::plan`). Measured,
//! one request, 384 tokens on gemma and 256 on qwen38, wall clock against
//! the stated ladder (`--priced false`) and plain decode:
//!
//! ```text
//!                         priced   ladder   plain      prices (ms): draft / 1 / 4 / 8 / 16

//! ```
//!
//! Prose on gemma goes from a 20% loss to within 3% of plain (the gate closes;
//! 20 of 355 fires draft); the A3B mixture gains 7-15% on the two workloads
//! its head helps and holds parity on the one it does not; the dense head
//! gains 8% on code and holds prose; the workloads the stated ladder already
//! had right pay up to 4% for the two plain fires that price the road and the
//! probes. The one-row fire is priced only in the baseline's own geometry
//! (nothing buffered behind it), because a plain fire right after a round
//! folds the round's survivors and is not the road's fire. Three things the
//! gate had to learn on the way, each measured before it was written down:
//! a closed gate judges on the probes fired SINCE it closed (a full window of
//! stale losses outvoted every probe and a run closed at round 33 stayed
//! closed to the end); two probes have to pay before it reopens (one is a
//! coin on a 30% prose); and it judges from two rounds, not eight (eight
//! warm-up rounds at eight rows on a prose that closes at once cost 5%).
//!
//! **A priced loop is not a deterministic function of its prompt.** The
//! prices come off a clock, the widths follow the prices, and on a trunk
//! whose bf16 bits depend on the fire's width (§ below) two runs of one
//! prompt can part at a near-tie — measured: two priced prose runs on
//! qwen38 came back 256 tokens each, same speed, different at one token.
//! `--priced false` or `--verify_rows` restores a deterministic loop. The
//! Qwen3.6-35B-A3B rows above are thinking prose: that head's chat template
//! opens `<think>` whatever the system prompt says, and `/no_think` did not
//! close it.
//!
//! # One thing the loop does NOT promise
//!
//! Token identity with one-token-a-fire decode holds until the first
//! near-tie, not forever. A sixteen-row verify fire folds its dot products
//! in a different order than the one-row point, and on a list of European
//! capitals at 256 tokens the two roads pick different capitals at index 154
//! — the same bf16 accumulation-order floor this repo already records for
//! whole-prefill against one-token-at-a-time. Short runs (64 and 128 tokens,
//! code and prose) do come back identical, and that is what the gate above
//! was verified against.
//!
//! # The verify width is worth choosing, and nothing chose it well
//!
//! The drafter proposes fifteen whatever the target reads — a block diffusion
//! model is out of distribution at any other block width — but the VERIFY
//! fire is priced by its rows, and the price is a STAIRCASE: the tile point
//! pads a fire up to a row block. `a_fire_is_priced_by_its_width` on this
//! box, in one-row fires: 1.00 / 1.83 / 2.79 / 5.19 / 5.00 at 1 / 8 / 16 /
//! 24 / 32 rows when the table below was taken — twelve then cost MORE than
//! sixteen (3.13) because the tile launched two eight-row blocks over the
//! padded sixteen; `quant::widen_rung` now takes the one sixteen-row tile
//! and twelve reads 2.61, under sixteen. The table stands as measured, and
//! the ladder's rungs stand too: re-priced on the acceptance distributions,
//! a twelve rung never beats eight. 256 tokens, wall clock:
//!
//! ```text
//!                      v=4     v=6     v=8     v=12    v=16
//! counting            9.96s   8.51s   7.14s   8.06s   6.37s
//! code                11.26   10.87    9.83   13.77   11.18
//! ```
//!
//! So the best width is a property of the WORKLOAD — sixteen where the block
//! is nearly all kept, eight where five tokens are — and it is worth up to
//! 20%. THREE rules to pick it per round were written and all three are a
//! wash, which is why the parameter is still the caller's to state:
//!
//! - **A smoothed accepted prefix** against the stated prices RATCHETS: at
//!   eight rows a prefix can never be observed above seven, so nothing ever
//!   argues for going back to sixteen. Recall went 10.37s to 15.19.
//! - **A two-armed bandit on the guest's own clock**, tokens per nanosecond
//!   with a probe floor on each arm, picked the losing arm on two of three
//!   workloads (code 10.67s against 9.31 fixed; recall 14.87 against 10.37).
//!   A run that MIXES widths keeps less per round than either pure run: the
//!   round boundaries move, so the arms do not sample one distribution.
//! - **The drafter's own logit margin** (`--margin_width`), the signal Dspark
//!   spends a trained confidence head on. Pooled it separates cleanly — over
//!   sixty anchors on five prompts a position inside the accepted prefix
//!   carries a margin of 6.86 and one outside 1.10, and the first seven
//!   positions' mean reads 7.95 where the prefix reached eight against 2.16
//!   where it did not. It is MISCALIBRATED exactly where the width matters:
//!   on recall the drafter is unsure and RIGHT — a factual token has many
//!   plausible rivals — so it sends long rounds to the narrow width. At a
//!   threshold of 4 recall goes 10.74s to 15.38; pulled back to 2 the three
//!   workloads come to 28.73s against a fixed sixteen's 29.15 and an oracle's
//!   27.27.
//!
//! What survives is the MEASUREMENT, not a policy. The margin costs 9% of a
//! round (3.28s against 3.01 over 64 tokens) because `top_k(logits, 2)` reads
//! the plane ONCE and returns the runner-up beside the proposal. Two consumers
//! of that plane cost about a second a round — 3.0s to 7.4s for a bare second
//! reduction, 46s with a softmax on it — which is the thing to know before
//! reaching for any other signal off a fire's logits.
//!
//! # A candidate tree does not pay here, and the arithmetic says so
//!
//! The drafter denoises every position from the SAME context in one pass, so
//! its guess at `j + 1` does not depend on its guess at `j` — a second
//! candidate at one position costs a parallel chain, not a second draft.
//! Branching at `j` lays out `j + 2 * (block - j)` rows: 31 for `j = 1`.
//!
//! At the break, the target's token was the drafter's RUNNER-UP 14 times in
//! 45 (31%), and `top_k` already carries it. But 31 rows are 5.00 + 0.27 =
//! 5.27 one-row fires against the linear block's 3.09, so the tree must
//! return 14.1 tokens a round where the block returns 8.27 — a prefix of 13.1
//! against 7.27. Recovering a third of the breaks is worth about one token.
//! Not close, and the reason is the width curve: on a GPU where sixteen rows
//! cost two one-row fires rather than 2.79, the same tree would be arguable.
//!
//! # The recurrence is a fold, not a cell
//!
//! This SKU is hybrid, so a verify fire that folded its rows would fold the
//! REJECTED ones too and no `kv_len` could take them back —
//! `rs-speculative-decoding`'s header is the argument in full. So the verify
//! window is BUFFERED (`fold-len` leaves it unfolded), the rejected tail is
//! forgotten with `discard-buffered`, and the NEXT round's verify folds
//! exactly the accepted prefix ahead of its own rows.
//!
//! The draft fire in between is the trap: a fire must bind one recurrent
//! working set per request and is CHARGED ITS ROWS in the buffer, even though
//! the trunk that owns the recurrence runs over none of a draft fire's rows.
//! Binding a scratch working set instead corrupts the sequence's state; the
//! fix is to fold nothing and forget the fire's own rows again, which leaves
//! the buffer exactly as it was found.
//!
//! **THE KV ROLLBACK IS THE SUBTLE PART.** The verify fire writes a row's
//! keys at `held + i` for all `block` rows, and the rows past the break
//! carried tokens the target rejected — so the next round states
//! `kv_len = held + kept + 1` and the stale rows are simply never read.
//! The drafter's own context rides the same rows (its context arm runs on
//! every trunk fire), so one length rolls both streams back.
