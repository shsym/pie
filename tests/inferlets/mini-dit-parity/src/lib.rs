//! The pie half of the `mini-dit` golden. Hands the model exactly what
//! `scripts/imagegen/mini_dit_ref.py` handed PyTorch — the patch rows, the
//! caption rows, the cross-attention context, the timestep and the three
//! rotary coordinates per row — and reads back the velocity the head
//! predicts, as JSON `scripts/imagegen/mini_dit_parity.py` turns into an
//! `.npz` under the golden's own key names.
//!
//! Two parity modes: one step against `mini_dit_dump_bf16.npz`'s `velocity`,
//! and the four-step Euler schedule against `mini_dit_euler_bf16.npz`'s
//! `euler.v{0..3}` / `euler.x{1..4}`.
//!
//! And two modes that need no golden because every claim they make is
//! WITHIN one fire's own answers: `--cfg` (classifier-free guidance on the
//! device, six lanes and two groups in one fire — `prototype.md` §1.1) and
//! `--cache` (step caching on the device, the whole Euler schedule as fires
//! with the cache decision carried in a channel from one fire to the next —
//! `.wiki/imagegen/conditional-fire.md`). Their harnesses are
//! `mini_dit_parity.py guidance` and `mini_dit_cache.py`.
//!
//! # THREE LANES, ONE GROUP, ONE FIRE
//!
//! `mini-dit`'s `denoise` reading declares three streams (D2), so one step
//! is three passes — caption, image, context — each stating its
//! [`stream`](inferlet::eta::attention::ForwardPass::stream) and all in one
//! [`group`](inferlet::eta::attention::ForwardPass::group), which is what
//! lets the caption rows join the image rows' attention and the context
//! rows serve as block 2's keys. Neither `attention` nor `embed` is called
//! on any of them: a denoise reading declares no kv space and no tokens,
//! and the image lane's row count comes from its latents channel.
//!
//! **ONE PIPELINE PER LANE.** A group is a fact about a FIRE: the three
//! passes join one attention only when they are members of one step. The
//! scheduler seals a frame when every live pipeline has submitted and never
//! seats two passes of one pipeline in one step, so three passes down one
//! pipeline are three fires — each lane attending alone, the context lane's
//! keys never seen. Three pipelines, one pass each, submitted back to back,
//! are what the wait-all seal composes into one fire.
//!
//! Only the image lane reads out — the caption stream ends after block 1,
//! and the head is image-only — so only it carries an epilogue.
//!
//! # WHY THE EULER LOOP IS ON THE HOST
//!
//! `latent-probe` integrates on the device, which is what a real sampler
//! does (D4) and what a real guest should copy. A parity harness wants the
//! opposite: every step's velocity AND every step's latent, at the
//! reference's own numbers, with nothing folded together. So this program
//! takes the velocity after each fire and steps the latent itself. The
//! arithmetic is `FlowMatchEuler`'s and the sigmas are the model's own
//! (`model::schedule()`), so what is checked is still the schedule the
//! family declares.
