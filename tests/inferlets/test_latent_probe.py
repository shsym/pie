"""The float-port loop closes (imagegen design D1/D3/D4) — a skeleton.

`latent-probe` drives one `forward` pass in a token-less, KV-less reading:
a latent channel seeded on the device by a keyed Normal draw, bound as
`input("latents")` beside `input("timestep")` and whatever else the reading
declares, stepped by an Euler epilogue over `velocity()`, and read back once
a fire. This gate asks only what a probe can ask without the family's
parity harness: the loop CLOSES. Every fire hands back `[rows, width]`
finite values, the loop-carried cells advance (the trace moves after the
seed), and the seed fire itself lands a unit-variance draw.

**WANTS A LOAD WITH A LATENT READING, AND SAYS SO RATHER THAN FAILING.** A
text row declares no readings, and the probe refuses it by name; that is the
correct answer for that load, reported as a skip. The run that means to
exercise the door names the mini-DiT row (the family lands in a later round):

    tests/inferlets/test_latent_probe.py --model <mini-dit checkpoint> \\
        --sku mini-dit-bf16-kv-bf16
