//! **THE MODEL-AGNOSTIC `text-to-image` INFERLET** (imagegen design D1, D4,
//! D11, D12): a prompt in, an image out, with nothing about any family
//! spelled here. Everything this program needs to size and drive the job is
//! a host-answered fact — `model::readings()`, `model::latent()`,
//! `model::schedule()`, `model::max_latent_rows()` — and every port and
//! reading is found by ROLE, never by name and never by `architecture()`.
//!
//! # HOW IT FINDS ITS THREE READINGS
//!
//! | role | the fact that says so |
//! |---|---|
//! | text encoder | `takes_tokens && readout == Hidden` |
//! | denoiser | `!takes_tokens && readout == Velocity` |
//! | VAE decode | a reading named `vae.decode` |
//!
//! A model with no text reading is refused BY NAME ("this model has no text
//! reading") — that is the right answer for the `mini-dit` fixture, whose
//! caption rows are random embeddings and which therefore cannot be told
//! what to draw.
//!
//! # THE STEP LOOP
//!
//! Two lanes of one request (D2), each on its own pipeline, submitted back
//! to back so the wait-all seal composes them into ONE fire: the prompt
//! lane (the stream the reading's `Context` port lists — `Text` for FLUX.2,
//! `Context` for Z-Image) carrying the encoder's rows, and the image lane
//! carrying the latent. Neither `embed` nor `attention` is called: a
//! denoise reading declares no tokens and no KV space.
//!
//! The sampler is an EPILOGUE (D4). Fire 0 seeds the latent with a keyed
//! Normal draw on the device — no 2 MB `Channel::from` through WASM — and
//! every later fire integrates one Euler step `x <- x + (sigma' - sigma).v`
//! over `velocity()`, advancing the loop-carried timestep and step cells.
//! `inferlet::latent::DenoiseLoop` owns the per-lane pipelines and clocks;
//! `seed_or_step` is the epilogue body.
//!
//! # POSITIONS COME FROM A FACT, NOT FROM THE FAMILY
//!
//! Where a lane's rows sit in the rotary space is a family contract — FLUX.2
//! puts the target grid at `(0, h, w, 0)` and text row `j` at `(0, 0, 0, j)`,
//! Z-Image puts the caption at `(1 + j, 0, 0)` and the image BEHIND it at
//! `(L + 1, a, b)` — so a guest that spelled either would be a guest for one
//! family. The reading states it instead (`reading-fact.positions`, a
//! `position-convention` of per-axis roles plus the text axis, its origin
//! and whether the image follows the caption on it), and
//! `latent::positions_for` fills both grids from the same code.
//!
//! # THE WAY OUT
//!
//! Two exits, and which one a model gets is its own fact.
//!
//! The intended one is D11, and it is wired: a model that declares a
//! `vae.decode` reading — a `Voxels` port and a `Pixels` readout — gets its
//! final latent unpatchified into the clip that port takes, fired on the
//! voxel axis, and read back off the `pixels` seam with
//! `intrinsics::pixels()`. `Channel::take_frames` turns that channel's cell
//! into a host-held `frames` handle and `session::send_frames` encodes and
//! streams it to the client, so the picture never enters linear memory.
//!
//! A model whose VAE is TRACED but not declared as a reading (FLUX.2 today:
//! its decoder's mid-block attention has no kernel arm, so its pixels would
//! not be the reference's) still takes the second exit, and the report says
//! which reading it saw.
//!
//! That second exit is the final latent as raw little-endian f32 through
//! `session::send_file_as`, under the name the report also states
//! (`<out>.latent.f32`), with the geometry a decode needs returned as the
//! JSON report — its sidecar. It is named for the same reason the picture
//! is: `pie run -o DIR` writes a file whose name says what it is rather
//! than a numbered `file-0000.bin`, and `scripts/imagegen/decode_latent.py`
//! finishes the job with the diffusers VAE of the same checkpoint.
//!
//! # CFG
//!
//! When the reading declares a `guidance` port the model is guidance-
//! distilled and the scale is just another lane vector; `--negative-prompt`
//! is then refused as meaningless. Without that port, a negative prompt at
//! `guidance > 1` runs a second lane PAIR (its own group, its own prompt
//! rows, its own latent), and the two velocities combine as
//! `u + s(c - u)` — ON THE DEVICE, inside the epilogue.
//!
//! The two branches are two attention GROUPS of one fire. They must not
//! attend each other (they are independent denoisings), and each names the
//! other with `ForwardPass::peer`, which is also what gathers them into one
//! cohort so they seal into one fire — a peer in another fire is not on
//! that fire's velocity plane at all. BOTH image lanes then compute the
//! same combine from their own side: the conditional one reads
//! `(own = c, peer = u)` and the unconditional one `(own = u, peer = c)`,
//! and `u + s(c - u)` is the same number either way. So both latents step
//! in lockstep without either crossing the host, and — unlike the old
//! host-combining path, which had to draw its own noise — the seeded device
//! draw is the same draw the ungated path makes.
//!
//! Neither shipped row exercises the guided path: klein-4B and Z-Image
//! Turbo are both guidance-distilled and take the scale as a port. What
//! proves the combine is `gates.py --only guidance`, on `mini-dit`.
