# text-to-image

The model-agnostic text-to-image sampler: a prompt in, a picture out, with no
family named anywhere in the guest. Everything it needs to size and drive the
job is a host-answered fact (imagegen design D1, D4, D11, D12).

## Run it

Build the guest once, then run it by name. `pie run` finds a bare name in the
`tests/inferlets` of the checkout the command runs in before it asks the
registry, so no `--path` and no `--manifest`:

```bash
cargo build -p text-to-image --release --target wasm32-wasip2   # from tests/inferlets
pie --config ~/.pie/config.<yours>.toml run text-to-image -o ./out -- \
    --prompt "a red bicycle leaning on a blue wall" \
    --width 1024 --height 1024 --steps 4 --seed 0 --out image
```

The config must bind a generative row (`pie model list` marks one
`text-to-image`) and must set `[engine] max_model_len = 32768`: a 1024²
job is 4096 latent rows a lane and the frame carries two fires, so the 4096
default refuses the second fire by name.

Two exits, and which one a model gets is its own fact.

A row that declares a drivable `vae.decode` reading gets `./out/image.png`:
the guest fires the VAE on the voxel axis, reads the `pixels` seam with
`intrinsics::pixels()`, and hands the channel's cell to `send_frames`, so the
picture never enters WASM memory. The report says `"decoded": true`.

A row whose VAE is traced but not declared as a reading (FLUX.2 today: its
decoder's mid-block attention has no kernel arm) gets the final latent under
the name the guest gave it, `./out/image.latent.f32`, plus the JSON report on
stdout, which is its sidecar. `scripts/imagegen/decode_latent.py` finishes the
job with the checkpoint's own diffusers VAE:

```bash
python scripts/imagegen/decode_latent.py --latent ./out/image.latent.f32 \
    --sidecar ./out/image.json --model-dir <the diffusers folder> --out ./out/image.png
```

## How it finds its way around

| role | the fact that says so |
|---|---|
| text encoder | `takes_tokens && readout == Hidden` |
| denoiser | `!takes_tokens && readout == Velocity` |
| VAE decode | `readout == Pixels`, and not the encoder |

The latent grid comes from `model::latent()`, the step count and trajectory
from `model::schedule()`, the row ceiling from `model::max_latent_rows()`, and
the rotary coordinates from the reading's own `positions` convention. A model
with no text reading is refused BY NAME ("this model has no text reading"),
which is the right answer for the `mini-dit` fixture.

The sampler is an eta epilogue: fire 0 seeds the latent with a keyed normal on
the device, and every later fire integrates one Euler step over `velocity()`.
Nothing large crosses into WASM.

## Gates

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<n> uv run python tests/inferlets/test_text_to_image.py --config ~/.pie/config.<yours>.toml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<n> uv run python tests/inferlets/test_generating_images.py --config ~/.pie/config.<yours>.toml
```

`test_text_to_image.py` is the gate on the sampler (the loop, the sigmas, the
refusal). `test_generating_images.py` is the gate on the user path (the facts
`pie model list` reports, the bare-name resolution, the named file, the PNG).

Long form: `website/docs/guide/model/generating-images.mdx`.
