//! Text completion inferlet for benchmarking — ETA bridge rewrite.
//!
//! Same harness contract as the classic version (exact token counts in the
//! final `Return` envelope, no per-token streaming, `ignore_eos` forces the
//! full `max_tokens` budget), expressed in the current architecture: an
//! N-wide prompt-prefill fire, then ONE decode pass whose sampled token is
//! device loop-carried, kept two fires ahead of the host drain by a single
//! frame-quantized run-ahead discipline (`top_up` — the same window rule at
//! every frame size k) — the sampler runs in-graph (argmax at temperature 0,
//! otherwise temperature-scaled TopP Gumbel-max), so the host never
//! round-trips per token.
//!
//! With stop tokens active (`ignore_eos = false`), the fires already staged
//! ahead when the host observes the stop drain and their outputs are ignored;
//! token counts remain unchanged.
//!
//! Lifecycle (R4-4 single-pipeline): prefill and decode are ONE sequential
//! stream on ONE pipeline. The prefill epilogue hands its sampled token to
//! the decode pass on-device (`tok_in`, a device-only channel attached to
//! both passes) and mirrors it to the host on `g0`, so decode fires are
//! submitted immediately after the prefill submit — the g0 host round-trip
//! runs in parallel, off the critical path. `close()` ends the stream after
//! the submitted tail is drained.
//!
//! `host_first_token` is the one arm that departs from that: the first token
//! travels out on `g0` and back as the decode's SEED, and the window is staged
//! behind that drain rather than in front of it. Everything after the first
//! token is device loop-carried either way. It exists for a plane whose
//! channel rings belong to the INSTANCE and not to the channel — see the input
//! field.
