"""Contention scenario table for pie's residency planner (Project Rainer).

Every scenario drives a REAL driver (no mock device) through
`benches/pie_bench.py` and aims one specific planner endgame path. The point
of the suite is LIVENESS, not throughput: a scenario that fails requests
loudly is acceptable, a scenario that hangs, livelocks, or silently stops
exercising its target path is a defect.

Each scenario carries a `Contract` — the properties that must hold for the
run to count as passing. Contracts are deliberately loose on numbers
(throughput moves with hardware) and strict on liveness:

* ``max_wall_s``       the run must finish; exceeding it is a hang.
* ``min_completed``    the fleet must make progress.
* ``max_failed``       bounded starvation kills.
* ``accounted``        completed + failed == requests (nothing vanishes).
* ``require_counters`` planner counters that MUST be non-zero, i.e. proof the
  scenario still reaches the path it claims to test. This is what stops a
  scenario from rotting into a no-op when policy changes underneath it. It is
  evaluated across *all* attempts of a scenario, not per attempt: several
  targets are reached probabilistically, and a per-attempt check would turn a
  repeated scenario into a coin flip.
* ``max_counters``     counters that must stay bounded. This is how the
  host-swap eviction livelock is regression-tested: its rollback counter ran
  to 1.2M when the victim scan re-picked the same blocked process forever.
* ``forbid_log``       substrings that must not appear in the engine log
  (``[frame-stall]`` is the frame-seal deadlock's tell).

Counter names are keys of the ``[planner-trace]`` line that ``bootstrap.rs``
emits when ``PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS`` is set.

``--swap-pool-size`` is a HOST-PINNED allocation (``cudaMallocHost`` in
``driver/cuda/src/store/swap_pool.cpp``, taken up front for every layer), so
it is not free headroom: pinned pages can be neither swapped nor reclaimed.
Size it from measured demand, not "generously". The scenarios here used to ask
for 8192-16384 pages against device pools of 12-256, which took the server to
32.3 GB RSS and pushed the host into reclaim -- ``/proc/pressure/memory``
``full avg10`` hit 66% during a run against 0.11% idle. The engine convoys
badly on that: a thread that stalls in the allocator while holding the global
KV store mutex freezes every lane behind it, and a KV lock trace (since
removed, along with the ``PIE_KV_LOCK_TRACE`` switch that armed it) caught
single ``create_working_set`` calls holding it for 1.07s, 1.55s and 5.74s. Downstream that reads as 9-18 lanes falling silent
at once, ``[frame-stall]``, and ``submit deadline exceeded`` -- i.e. it looks
exactly like an engine scheduling bug. Every scenario that was flaky used
16384; none that used <= 512 ever was.

Measured peak use at 1024 is 12 pages (churn), 4 (churn_extreme), 108 (soak),
215 (mixed_head), so 1024 is still 4.7x the worst case. Right-sizing took the
suite from five flaky scenarios to 17/17, churn from 15-44s to 8.1s, and
churn_extreme from 10.8-33.6s to 11.1s on all four repeats.
