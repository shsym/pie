"""Contention scenario table for pie's residency planner (Project Rainer).

Every scenario drives a REAL driver (no mock device) through
`benches/pie_bench.py` and aims one specific planner endgame path. The point
of the suite is LIVENESS, not throughput: a scenario that fails requests
loudly is acceptable, a scenario that hangs, livelocks, or silently stops
exercising its target path is a defect.

Each scenario carries a `Contract` — the properties that must hold for the
run to count as passing. Contracts are deliberately loose on numbers
(throughput moves with hardware) and strict on liveness:

* ``max_wall_s``       the run must finish; exceeding it is a hang.
* ``min_completed``    the fleet must make progress.
* ``max_failed``       bounded starvation kills.
* ``accounted``        completed + failed == requests (nothing vanishes).
* ``require_counters`` planner counters that MUST be non-zero, i.e. proof the
  scenario still reaches the path it claims to test. This is what stops a
  scenario from rotting into a no-op when policy changes underneath it. It is
  evaluated across *all* attempts of a scenario, not per attempt: several
  targets are reached probabilistically, and a per-attempt check would turn a
  repeated scenario into a coin flip.
* ``max_counters``     counters that must stay bounded. This is how the
  host-swap eviction livelock is regression-tested: its rollback counter ran
  to 1.2M when the victim scan re-picked the same blocked process forever.
* ``forbid_log``       substrings that must not appear in the engine log
  (``[frame-stall]`` is the frame-seal deadlock's tell).

Counter names are keys of the ``[planner-trace]`` line that ``bootstrap.rs``
emits when ``PIE_CONTENTION_TRACE_MS`` is set.
