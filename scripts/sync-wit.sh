# One-way sync of the canonical WIT interface into the vendored SDK copy.
#
# Source of truth: crates/inferlet/wit/  (the single `pie:inferlet` package —
# world.wit + the sibling interface files + a vendored deps/ tree of the
# wasi 0.3 packages the wasmtime host implements).
#
# Vendored copy (DO NOT hand-edit):
#   - sdk/inferlet/tools/bakery/src/bakery/wit/
#
# It is the LAST one. The Rust guest used to need a second: the canonical WIT
# lived in a sibling crate while `inferlet` held the `wit_bindgen::generate!`
# site, and `generate!`'s `path` is a filesystem path resolved at macro
# expansion, so a published `.crate` could only reach a `wit/` inside its own
# package directory — hence a byte-identical mirror beside the generator.
# Putting the canonical package in `inferlet` itself makes that path `"wit"`,
# a plain subdirectory, so the mirror had nothing left to do. bakery's copy
# stays because bakery is a Python package: it can vendor a directory, not
# link a rlib.
#
# The copy is a full mirror of the package: the interface *.wit files + world.wit
# are copied directly, and deps/ (the vendored wasi 0.3 wit) is copied verbatim.
# Manual three-way editing of this copy has regressed twice
# (see commit 94043eb1); run this instead.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-wit.sh          # sync the copy in place
#   scripts/sync-wit.sh --check  # verify the copy is in sync (CI); non-zero on drift
#
