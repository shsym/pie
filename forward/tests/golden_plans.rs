//! Golden traced forms.
//!
//! The unit tests argue that individual ops are right; this one checks the
//! thing a driver actually receives: the whole traced form, byte for byte,
//! for the family configurations the executor runs. Its value is not that
//! any particular op is *right* — it is that a change to the traced form
//! cannot happen quietly. The executor's op→kernel mapping is a
//! deterministic walk of this structure, so pinning the structure pins the
//! emitted kernel sequence too: this is the CI-enforceable half of the
//! parity story, the half that needs no GPU
//! (`driver/cuda/src/model/llama_like/declared_forward.cpp` is the other).
//!
//! Regenerate after an intended change:
//!
//! ```text
//! UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 cargo test -p pie-forward --test golden_plans
//! ```
//!
//! The pattern is `loader/tests/golden_plans.rs`, including the rule that a
//! regenerated golden is a diff a human reads and approves.
