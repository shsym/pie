//! The forward crate's C entry points.
//!
//! The driver calls in here; nothing calls out. The rules are the loader's
//! (`loader/src/ffi/entry.rs:1-19`), restated for this smaller surface:
//!
//! * **Never unwind.** A panic crossing into C++ is not something the driver
//!   can act on. The loader relies on `extern "C"`'s abort-on-unwind; here
//!   the catch is explicit — [`abort_on_panic`] — which changes nothing
//!   about the outcome and states the intent where the reader is. Nothing in
//!   this module converts a panic into a status code: a panic here is a
//!   tracer bug, and the shipping profile is `panic = "abort"` anyway
//!   (workspace `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release-min]`).
//! * **Never hold global state.** Tracing allocates nothing reachable except
//!   through the plan header it fills in, so concurrent traces (one per
//!   model, or per rank) cannot observe each other.
//! * **Status answers *did it work*.** The loader splits status from a
//!   diagnostics list because verification produces many findings; tracing
//!   produces none — the only failure mode is a malformed argument — so
//!   there is no diagnostics channel to carry, and the status is the whole
//!   answer.

/// Lower a traced plan over one fire's rows — the SHADOW comparison's
/// Rust half (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` migration step 6).
///
/// The driver walks a nested region IR; `lower` produces the flat launch
/// list that is meant to replace it. Calling both on the same fire and
/// comparing is how the replacement earns the right to happen, and this
/// is the entry point for the comparing.
///
/// It EXECUTES NOTHING. The result is a description of what would run.
///
/// `*out` points into storage the plan owns, valid until the next call
/// on the SAME plan (one slot). Copy or compare before calling again; do
/// not free it — `pie_forward_release` does, with the plan.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `plan` is null or points at a writable header built by one of the
/// trace entry points and not yet released; `rows` is null or points at
/// `rows_len` readable [`PieForwardRow`]s; `out` is null or a writable
/// slot.
