//! The forward crate's C entry points.
//!
//! The driver calls in here; nothing calls out. The rules are the loader's
//! (`loader/src/ffi/entry.rs:1-19`), restated for this smaller surface:
//!
//! * **Never unwind.** A panic crossing into C++ is not something the driver
//!   can act on. The loader relies on `extern "C"`'s abort-on-unwind; here
//!   the catch is explicit — [`abort_on_panic`] — which changes nothing
//!   about the outcome and states the intent where the reader is. Nothing in
//!   this module converts a panic into a status code: a panic here is a
//!   tracer bug, and the shipping profile is `panic = "abort"` anyway
//!   (workspace `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release-min]`).
//! * **Never hold global state.** Tracing allocates nothing reachable except
//!   through the plan header it fills in, so concurrent traces (one per
//!   model, or per rank) cannot observe each other.
//! * **Status answers *did it work*.** The loader splits status from a
//!   diagnostics list because verification produces many findings; tracing
//!   produces none — the only failure mode is a malformed argument — so
//!   there is no diagnostics channel to carry, and the status is the whole
//!   answer.
