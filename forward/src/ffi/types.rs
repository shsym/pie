//! `#[repr(C)]` mirror of the traced form.
//!
//! These types are the forward crate's published vocabulary: the driver walks
//! them in place, so every field here is part of the ABI. The design copies
//! `loader/src/ffi/types.rs` deliberately — flat POD, read-only, consumed by
//! C++ walking `PieForwardPlan::ops` in execution order — and the same two
//! rules govern this module:
//!
//! * **No owning types.** Every aggregate is a pointer + length pair into an
//!   arena owned by [`crate::ffi::arena::PlanArena`]. Slices stay valid
//!   exactly as long as the `PieForwardPlan` that produced them.
//! * **No `Option`, no niches.** `Option<u32>` is spelled as a sentinel
//!   ([`PIE_FORWARD_NO_LAYER`], [`PIE_FORWARD_NO_NAME`]) so the layout is
//!   legible from C without knowing Rust's niche rules.
//!
//! Where the loader's plan needed a tagged union (`PieLoaderStorageOp`
//! carries per-operation operand structs), the traced form does not: every
//! op fits `kind + layer + weight name + two u32 params + selector +
//! operand ranges`, so [`PieForwardOp`] stays a plain struct and the
//! per-kind meaning of the params is documented on it.
