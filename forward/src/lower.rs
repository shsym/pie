//! LOWERING — the traced form to a flat launch list
//! (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` "What one fire lowers to", migration step 6).
//!
//! ```text
//! per statement: compute extent (rows × layers)
//! match arms    → partition the extent into blocks
//! one Launch per rectangle
//! ```
//!
//! The target the doc states for the driver is a loop with no vocabulary
//! in it at all:
//!
//! ```cpp
//! for (const Launch& L : frame.launches)
//!     KERNELS[L.kernel](args + L.args, L.rows.lo, L.rows.hi,
//!                       L.layers.lo, L.layers.hi, stream);
//! ```
//!
//! **This is what a declared fire runs.** `declared_forward.cpp` builds
//! the rows, calls `pie_forward_lower`, and executes the result; its
//! walk over the region IR was deleted in the cutover's step 3, so there
//! is no second form and no switch between them. The one remaining
//! consumer of the traced form that does NOT come through here is the
//! generated `.inc` — an ahead-of-time emission of the same declaration
//! that also carries the unionized supergraph build.
//!
//! # Three decisions this module makes, from the doc's amendments
//!
//! **Row order is the ENGINE's.** `lower` takes the rows as the
//! scheduler's seriation already ordered them
//! (`runtime/engine/src/scheduler/fire_plan.rs`) and does not choose a
//! permutation. Two independent permutation choosers would drift, and
//! the engine's is the one coupled to admission, framing and wave
//! discipline. What `lower` may do is REPORT what an order costs
//! ([`Lowered::rectangles`]), which is useful feedback for the seriation
//! key.
//!
//! **`Uncovered` is an ADMISSION answer, not a runtime fire split.** The
//! doc's sketch routed it to "the scheduler splits the fire", which
//! changes scheduling behaviour, and this project's standing constraint
//! is that runtime scheduling does not change — tart is a driver
//! feature. So [`Uncovered`] is what a group that cannot be served looks
//! like BEFORE it is formed: the engine's `LaunchGrouping::accepts`
//! already refuses unservable combinations, and this is the same answer
//! computed from the trace instead of from a hand-written rule.
//!
//! **`lower` assigns the buffers.** The DSL is pure SSA and carries no
//! buffer notion, so choosing one is a backend job — and it was the job
//! both CUDA executors did as FAMILY CONVENTION ("the normed activation
//! is `ws.norm_y`" in one, `ws.norm_x` in the other), which is what made
//! the executor two files. [`Buffers`] does it once, from the values'
//! own extents and liveness.

/// Where each SSA value's bytes live.
///
/// A PINNED value is not allocated here at all: its bytes ARE the named
/// buffer's, and which buffer that is is the backend's binding. So
/// `offset[v] == NAMED` says "ask the backend", and such values are
/// excluded from [`Buffers::bytes`].
///
/// The DSL carries no buffer notion — `rmsnorm(x: &Val) -> Val` — so
/// choosing one is a backend job, and it is the job both CUDA executors
/// did as family convention. Doing it here, once, from the values' own
/// extents and liveness, is what lets an arm ask by value id and stay
/// family-blind.
///
/// A layer-unrolled plan names 28 distinct "normed activation" values
/// whose live ranges never overlap, so liveness reuse keeps the whole
/// frame inside a handful of buffers' worth of arena.
///
/// PINS are the exception: values that machinery OUTSIDE the traced ops
/// reaches by name — the query a hook observes, the normed activation an
/// adapter's host setup captures, the logits the sampler reads. The seam
/// signatures declare exactly that set (`sees`), so pins are derivable
/// rather than a per-family table. One empirical warning, paid for once:
/// a pin must be declared BY CONSUMER, not producer. A lowered trace may
/// state its attention as a stated-kernel `Launch` rather than a
/// semantic `Attention` op, so "the value o_proj reads lives in the
/// attention output buffer" is the sentence that holds under both
