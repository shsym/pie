/// Authoring a load contract from C++ (architecture.md §12 row 12).
///
/// A contract is the *program* half of `plan = compile(source, program,
/// target)`. It names every tensor the driver wants, and for each one gives an
/// expression over the checkpoint's tensors that produces it. The loader
/// type-checks the expression against what the files actually contain, lowers
/// it to storage instructions, and schedules them; it does not decide *what* to
/// build, which is the whole point.
///
/// The driver already holds every fact this needs. `llama_like`'s
/// `Hq = num_attention_heads * head_dim` and its `must(engine, p +
/// "self_attn.o_proj.weight")` are exactly the shape and the name that used to
/// be re-derived inside the loader's `arch/` passes from a second, independent
/// reading of `config.json`. Two readings that can disagree is one too many.
///
/// # The algebra
///
/// Twelve node kinds, mirroring `crate::contract::Expr` one for one. They are
/// grouped by the invariant each one preserves, because that -- not the name --
/// is what tells you which of them to reach for:
///
/// | Node                             | Preserves            | Meaning                                     |
/// |----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
/// | `src(name)`                      | --                   | A tensor as it appears in the checkpoint    |
/// | `out(name)`                      | --                   | An earlier `define` in this contract        |
/// | `fill(value, shape, enc)`        | --                   | A constant tensor; a `concat` leg that pads |
/// | `slice(x, axis, start, len)`     | bytes, values, type  | A contiguous band along one axis            |
/// | `stride(x, axis, start, len, k)` | bytes, values, type  | Every `k`-th element along one axis         |
/// | `gather(x, axis, {i, j, k})`     | bytes, values, type  | The elements at those indices, in order     |
/// | `concat({a, b, c}, axis)`        | bytes, values, type  | The parts joined, in the order given        |
/// | `shard(x, axis)`                 | bytes, values, type  | This rank's slice of a TP-split axis        |
/// | `transmute(x, shape, enc)`       | bytes                | Same bytes under a new type; one `-1` is inferred |
/// | `scale(x, factor)`               | type                 | Multiply every element                      |
/// | `cast(x, enc)`                   | values               | The same values in another representation   |
/// | `repack(x, spec, out)`           | values, type         | An opaque kernel-specific relayout          |
///
/// The five that preserve all three move bytes and nothing else: what comes out
/// is a rearrangement of what went in, and every one of them compiles to byte
/// runs the loader can read straight out of the checkpoint.
///
/// `transmute` is free as well — it renames bytes without moving them. The
/// other three cost a kernel. `repack` preserves everything the five do except
/// placement, and it is held to that: it may pad, and it may not reinterpret an
/// element. It is a relayout priced as a kernel, not an escape hatch for
/// whatever a relayout could be made to do.
///
/// `slice`, `stride` and `gather` are three rungs of one cost ladder, and the
/// author picks the rung. A band leaves every run in the source intact; a
/// stride cuts the source into one run per element; a gather is what is left
/// when no arithmetic describes the order. The loader refuses a list that a
/// cheaper node could express, so the ladder cannot be climbed by accident.
/// For the same reason neither `stride` nor `gather` may touch a quantized
/// axis, where a `slice` may as long as it lands on group boundaries.
///
/// No model has needed `gather` yet. It is the rung that makes the other two
/// the cheap ends of one operation rather than a pair of special cases, so it
/// stays; reach for it only when no arithmetic describes the order you want.
///
/// `shard` is the only node that means different things on different ranks, and
/// it is resolved before anything downstream of it runs — which is why a
/// contract is written once for the whole TP group rather than once per rank.
///
/// `transmute` and `cast` are duals and are easy to confuse, so: a transmute
/// keeps the *bytes* and gives them a new name, a cast keeps the *values* and
/// rewrites them. One is free, the other runs a converter. Rust spells the
/// same pair `transmute` and `as`.
///
/// `scale` and `cast` are the two nodes that change a value, and they change it
/// in different ways: `scale` by arithmetic the author asked for, `cast` only
/// by the error of the representation it lands in.
///
/// # Shapes and encodings are both predictions
///
/// `define(name, expr, encoding)` states what the tensor should *be*, and both
/// halves of that are claims about the expression, checked against what it
/// actually yields. A driver whose model of the checkpoint is wrong gets a
/// compile error rather than a plausible-looking wrong buffer.
///
/// A conversion is never inferred from a declaration that disagrees. Ask for it
/// with `cast`, so that a line that runs a kernel does not look like a line that
/// does not.
///
/// The shape half may be declined: omitting `expect` is the honest declaration
/// for a packed quantized weight, whose on-disk extents belong to the quantizer
/// that produced the file and not to the model.
///
/// # Ownership
///
/// The builder owns every name, shape and node; `view()` lends a borrowed POD
/// snapshot. The builder must outlive the `pie_loader_compile_contract` call and
/// must not be mutated while a view is outstanding.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// pie_loader::ModelContract c;
/// auto q = c.src("model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.weight");
/// auto k = c.src("model.layers.0.self_attn.k_proj.weight");
