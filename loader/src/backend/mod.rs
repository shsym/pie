//! Backend-specific compilation decisions.
//!
//! §9 draws the line these modules sit on. A fact the driver can *measure* is
//! data and travels in [`StorageTarget`]; a rule that differs per backend and
//! cannot be parameterized is code and lives here. It is the same split LLVM
//! draws between target features and `TargetLowering`.
//!
//! Everything here answers a question the C++ driver used to answer at run time.
//! That mattered less for being wrong than for being *unrecorded*:
//! `driver/cuda/src/loader/transcode_engine.hpp` chose a tile size and a fusion
//! strategy while executing, so one plan could run two different kernel
//! sequences and nothing in the plan said which (§8.1). Deciding here puts the
//! answer in the plan, which puts it in the plan hash, which makes "the plan
//! determines execution" true rather than aspirational.
