//! Does this plan honour its contract?
//!
//! Verification is deliberately not a second compiler. It takes the plan
//! exactly as the driver sees it and asks questions that can be answered from
//! the plan alone plus the filesystem — which is what makes it a *second
//! opinion* rather than a restatement (`architecture.md` §8). The compiler and
//! this module share no code: if `compile` had a bug that made it emit a plan
//! that does not produce a declared tensor, nothing in `compile` would notice,
//! because the same wrong belief produced both halves.
//!
//! The driver-side counterpart in `loaded_model.cpp` compares
//! `covered_contract_count` against `runtime_tensor_count`, but both are
//! assigned from `view.tensors.len` — it is literally `if (x != x)`. The real
//! check lives here, where the two sides being compared were derived
//! separately.
