//! The model contract: a declaration of what the driver needs, as expressions
//! over the checkpoint's byte space.
//!
//! See `loader/spec.md` for the design rationale. In short: the driver declares
//! every tensor it wants and where its bytes come from; the loader decides how
//! to move them. Neither side needs to know the model family.
//!
//! This module owns the *declaration* and its type checker. Lowering an [`Expr`]
