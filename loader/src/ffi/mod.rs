//! The loader's FFI boundary.
//!
//! `types` is the published `#[repr(C)]` vocabulary, `arena` turns a compiled
//! [`LoadPlan`](crate::plan::LoadPlan) into it, and `entry` holds the
//! `extern "C"` functions the driver calls. The generated header
//! (`loader/include/pie_loader.h`) is the C view of exactly these three files.
//!
//! This is the only boundary the design has (§10). There is no serialized form:
//! a plan is compiled and executed in one process, so a JSON round-trip would be
//! a second representation to keep in step with no reader on the far end.
