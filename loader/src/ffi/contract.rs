//! The model contract, as a POD graph the driver builds and the loader reads.
//!
//! This is the direction the plan boundary does not go. `arena.rs` marshals a
//! *result* — Rust allocates, C++ borrows until release — whereas a contract is
//! an *argument*: C++ owns it, the loader borrows it for the length of one call
//! and copies whatever it keeps. That makes it strictly the easier half, and it
//! is the half that matters, because it is what lets the driver stop asking for
//! a model by name and start declaring what it wants (architecture.md §12 row
//! 12).
//!
//! # Why a flat array
//!
//! An [`crate::contract::Expr`] is a tree with `Box` and `Vec` in it, neither of
//! which has a stable layout, so it cannot cross as itself. The standard
//! encoding is a topologically sorted node array where every edge is an index —
//! the same shape as an SSA function body, and for the same reason. Two
//! properties fall out of requiring a child index to be *strictly less* than its
//! parent's:
//!
//! * the graph is acyclic by construction, so the reader needs no visited set;
//! * a shared subexpression is one node with two parents, which is what a
//!   contract that publishes views into a bank actually is.
//!
//! # Why one flat node struct rather than a union
//!
//! A tagged union in C++ needs either a discriminated-union library or manual
//! placement, and a designated initializer cannot span one. A flat struct with
//! per-kind fields costs about 150 bytes a node — a few hundred kilobytes for
//! the largest contract, borrowed for one call — and buys the property that a
//! field the caller forgot is a zero, not garbage from another variant.
