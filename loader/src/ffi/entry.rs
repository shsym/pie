//! The loader's C entry points.
//!
//! The driver calls in here; nothing calls out. Three rules hold for every
//! function in this module:
//!
//! * **Never unwind.** A panic crossing into C++ is not something the driver can
//!   act on, and Rust already handles it: an unwind out of an `extern "C"`
//!   function prints the panic and aborts. That is the honest outcome — a panic
//!   here is a loader bug, and the shipping profile is `panic = "abort"`
//!   (`Cargo.toml` `[profile.release-min]`) so no unwinding happens at all.
//!   Nothing in this module tries to convert one into a status code.
//! * **Never hold global state.** Ranks compile in parallel
//!   (`runtime/engine/src/driver/backend/cuda.rs:331-345` runs one thread per
//!   rank), so two `pie_loader_compile` calls can be in flight at once. Every
//!   allocation is reachable only from the handle it is returned through.
//! * **Status answers *did it work*; diagnostics answer *what went wrong*.** The
//!   status code is a single value and verification produces a list, so
//!   collapsing the two would throw away the thing that makes verification worth
//!   running.
