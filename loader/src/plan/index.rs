//! Finding things in a plan.
//!
//! Every id a plan carries is dense and assigned in push order, so a lookup is
//! an array index. It was not written that way: `buffers.iter().find()` and
//! `tensors.iter().find()` appeared in the passes, in the memory accounting and
//! in the backend lowering, which made compilation quadratic in tensor count —
//! 2.1 s for a 32k-tensor checkpoint, of which two scans were most of it.
//!
//! The fix is not a cache but an invariant, checked on every access: if
//! `buffers[i].id != BufferId(i)` something built the plan wrong, and that is
//! an `Internal` error rather than a silently slow path.
