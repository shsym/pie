//! The pass pipeline.
//!
//! A pass is a named function over a finished plan that says how many rewrites
//! it made. Both halves matter. The name means a new pass is a line in
//! `passes::all()` rather than a line buried in the middle of the compiler; the
//! count means a pass that never fires is *visible* rather than inferred.
//!
//! v1 had neither. Its seven passes were seven statements in the middle of
//! `StorageCompiler::lower`, and its eighth — the `optimizer`, 276 lines — was
//! a separate stage over a separate IR that reported `rewrites: 0` on all
//! fourteen goldens because the frontend could not construct the patterns it
//! matched. Nobody noticed, because the only reader of the report was a debug
//! dump.
