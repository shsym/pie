//! The passes that run over a finished plan, and the order they run in.
//!
//! The order is the whole file: every pass here reads a plan the one before it
//! produced, and three of them only work because an earlier one has already
//! run — nothing can be coalesced into arena-relative writes before
//! `assign-persistent-offsets` has decided where the arena puts things, and
//! nothing can be counted before the coalescing is done. Under v1 this order
//! was seven consecutive statements in the middle of a 954-line file.
//!
//! The four modules split by what a pass *does*, not by what it touches:
//! [`arena`] assigns the persistent offsets everything downstream reads,
//! [`rewrite`] rewrites the schedule, [`memory`] recounts it, and [`validate`]
//! only refuses. Nothing here is re-exported as a prelude — a pass names what
//! it uses, so moving one is a matter of moving its imports with it.
