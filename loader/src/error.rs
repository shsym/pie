//! What can go wrong, by whose fault it is.
//!
//! The compiler used to answer every question with `InvalidInput(String)` — two
//! variants and 284 construction sites, so the type carried no information and
//! the string carried all of it. A C caller could not match on it, a test could
//! not assert on it without matching prose, and nothing distinguished "your
//! contract asks for something impossible" from "this checkpoint is corrupt"
//! from "the compiler broke".
//!
//! Each variant below names a *place* the fault lives, which is the only
//! distinction a caller can act on:
//!
//! | Variant | Whose fault | What the caller should do |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`Error::Contract`] | the driver's declaration | fix the contract |
//! | [`Error::Shard`] | the declaration, at this TP degree | fix the contract or the degree |
//! | [`Error::Checkpoint`] | the file on disk | get a different checkpoint |
//! | [`Error::Unsupported`] | the target's executor | use another backend, or teach it |
//! | [`Error::Overflow`] | a size no representation holds | none — the model is too big for this field |
//! | [`Error::Internal`] | the loader | file a bug |
