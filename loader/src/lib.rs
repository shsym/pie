//! Runtime-owned planner for Pie model loading.
//!
//! `plan = compile(source_facts, program, target)`. None of the three inputs is
//! a model's name: the driver states what it needs as a contract over the
//! checkpoint's byte space, the loader reads the checkpoint's own metadata, and
//! the target carries the numbers a device measured. `tests/standalone.rs` pins
//! that as four properties rather than as prose.
//!
//! CUDA and `WeightStore` ownership stay on the C++ side. Reading a checkpoint
//! is `crate::checkpoint`'s alone, and the compiler below it opens nothing —
//! `crate::host_executor` does, which is exactly why it is not the compiler.
