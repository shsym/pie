//! The checkpoint, as a value the driver can read before it writes a contract.
//!
//! `plan = compile(source_facts, program, target)` has three inputs, and this
//! module is the first of them. A driver cannot author a contract without
//! knowing what the files contain: whether this checkpoint ships a fused
//! `qkv_proj` or three separate projections, whether the MoE experts are one
//! stacked tensor or one per expert, what the on-disk extents of a packed AWQ
//! weight actually are. Every one of those questions is answered by the tensor
//! table, and every one of them is what the loader's own `arch/` passes were
//! reading the table for.
//!
//! # Why a handle and not a directory
//!
//! The obvious API is `compile(snapshot_dir, contract, target)`, with the
//! loader parsing the headers itself. That reads the checkpoint twice — once
//! for the driver to write the contract against, once inside the compile — and
//! two reads of a file that can change between them can disagree. Opening the
//! checkpoint once and passing the handle makes the source facts a *value*, so
//! the contract and the plan are provably about the same bytes.
//!
//! It also makes the split in `checkpoint::read` visible from C++: this is the
//! only entry point that touches the filesystem before execution.
