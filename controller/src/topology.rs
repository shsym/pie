//! The planner — a **pure** function from cluster membership to the two
//! published snapshots. This is the controller's "brain"; the neighbor policy is
//! deliberately trivial for now (every worker peers with all others) behind a
//! single seam ([`neighbors_for`]) so a real PD-pairing / TP-grouping policy
//! drops in later without touching the actor or the wire.
//!
//! The gateway view is **global** (same for every gateway), so the wire
//! [`RoutingTable`] is produced directly. The worker view is **per-worker**, so
//! the internal [`Topology`] holds every worker's wire-ready peer list keyed by
//! id; the service projects one [`Neighbors`] from it per `watch_worker`.
