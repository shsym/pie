//! Deferred HA seam — [`StateStore`].
//!
//! Today the controller is **soft-state**: the cluster lives only in the actor's
//! memory and is rebuilt by clients re-registering after a restart (the
//! `Ack::ReRegister` path). This trait is the seam where a future
//! highly-available controller would persist/replicate membership behind the
//! *same* single-writer actor, so a failover survivor keeps the registry without
//! waiting for every node to re-register.
//!
//! **Not implemented.** Stub + docs only — the actor does not call it yet. The
//! default [`SoftState`] is the explicit "persist nothing" choice.
