//! Resource-aware admission — the coarse, cluster-level gate (design §7, first
//! step in the per-turn `admission → route → dispatch` sequence).
//!
//! This is the gateway's "real rate limit": it gates on cluster **resources**
//! (KV-cache pressure, in-flight sequences) rather than request volume — the
//! thing the edge structurally cannot do (a request can be 100 or 100k tokens,
//! so req/s does not describe load; the edge gates *volume*, the gateway gates
//! *resources*, and they do not overlap).
//!
//! It is deliberately **coarse**: "should the cluster admit this turn at all?".
//! The authoritative, per-worker decision is the worker's own final admission
//! ([`Accepted::Reject`](pie_worker_rpc::Accepted) during dispatch), so a
//! slightly stale [`RoutingTable`] here is safe. v1 reads only the controller's
//! pushed coarse load (`RoutingTable.coarse_load`, already flowing via
//! `watch_gateway`); real per-tenant token-budget accounting is a later
//! graduation that grows its own inputs (it does not belong on the spine).
//!
//! Reached through [`RoutingHandle::admit`](crate::route::RoutingHandle::admit)
//! so the cluster-table read is single-sourced off the one routing watch; the
//! logic itself lives here as its own §7 step.
