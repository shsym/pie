//! Worker-facing **data plane** — the gateway is the SERVER; workers dial IN.
//!
//! Post-inversion (Pie 0.5.0, design §4/§8) the topology flips: instead of the
//! gateway dialing each worker per session, every worker dials INTO the gateway
//! (1:N fan-in). The gateway is the stable listening endpoint; the heavy token
//! traffic flows worker→gateway on the plain client→server direction
//! ([`GatewayInbound::push_tokens`]), and the latency-sensitive commands flow
//! reverse ([`WorkerControl`]) over the SAME connection, split at accept time by
//! [`accept_gateway_link`] (the `spawn_twoway` mux, isolated in `pie-worker-rpc`).
//!
//! This module owns:
//! - [`WorkerRegistry`] — the live `WorkerId → WorkerControlClient` map plus a
//!   coalesced `connected_watch` of the connected set (the `(b)` half of routing:
//!   a worker is dispatchable only once it has dialed in and `register`ed).
//! - [`serve`] — the accept loop: per connection split the link, serve
//!   `GatewayInbound`, and on the first `register` move the reverse
//!   `WorkerControlClient` into the registry; on connection drop, evict it (the
//!   worker-drop signal alpha's selector + charlie's `Sessions` re-dispatch react
//!   to via `connected_watch`).
