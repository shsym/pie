//! `golden-{msl,cuda}/` are dumps of a C++ oracle that has since been deleted,

//! `golden-extended/` says exactly that in its header.

//! What that buys: not correctness — nothing here was ever checked against a
//! second implementation — but *change detection*. A rewrite that alters what
//! these 55 ops, 8 intrinsics, 4 schedules and 4 stages compile to has to say
//! so out loud instead of moving under a corpus that never looked.
