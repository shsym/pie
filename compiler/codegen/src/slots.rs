//! Which operand goes in which kernel slot.
//!
//! `ptir_m1_execute` takes five pointers -- three in, two out -- and the rule
//! for filling them from an op is part of the M1 op ABI, not part of any one
//! backend. It was written three times: `metal::fused::slots_for`, the same
//! function reused by the grouped path, and an inline copy in `cuda::fused`.
//!
//! The rules are small and every one of them is silent when wrong. If a
//! backend forgets that `pivot_threshold` passes its predicate payload in `a1`
//! it reads whatever the second operand slot held; if it forgets the second
//! result it writes one output and leaves the other pointing at scratch. Both
//! produce a kernel that compiles and runs.
//!
//! What is genuinely per-backend is how a value id becomes a pointer
//! expression -- Metal indexes a shared `offsets` table, CUDA resolves reshape
//! aliases first -- so that is the parameter.
