//! #23 (A-scoped) FOUND-abort overlap verify — the device-UAF empirical teeth.
//!
//! THE EMPIRICAL GAP this closes (the ONE thing the co-stream structural argument
//! + alpha's host-cascade unit tests can't 100% close): a producer that has
//! ALREADY retained its sampled copy (so the consumer's inject IS enqueued from a
//! valid device buffer), then HOST-aborts (`effective_success=false`) — so the
//! forward-gated deferred-free races the consumer's in-flight inject. That's the
//! "retain-FOUND-then-abort" case. The retain-MISS path has no buffer → no UAF
//! surface (host-cascade-discarded; alpha's 8 Part A unit tests pin it).
//!
//! HOW the overlap is driven: the `runahead` inferlet decodes through
//! `collect_tokens_pipelined`, which eager-one-ahead SUBMITS the consumer (t+1)
//! BEFORE awaiting the producer (t) — i.e. the consumer's inject is enqueued while
//! the producer is still in flight (the overlap). `MAX_IN_FLIGHT=2` (one-step
//! run-ahead active). So this harness EXTENDS `cuda_runahead`'s proven overlap —
//! no separate overlap setup. The happy-path (no injection) is `cuda_runahead`
//! itself (GREEN: `MATCH=true ANCHOR_OK=true CLEAR_OK=true`) = the non-degenerate
//! CONTROL this RED-injected run is the counterpart to.
//!
//! THE FAULT INJECTION (alpha's env-gated seam, inference.rs finalize path, the
//! #19 `PIE_MIROSTAT_DUMP` precedent — zero prod-path when unset, test-flagged):
//!   `success = forward_result.is_some() && !test_force_producer_abort(&deps)`
//! keyed on `deps.produced == PIE_TEST_ABORT_PRODUCER_LINK`. Firing AFTER
//! `rx.await == Some` = device-valid-but-host-aborts = the FOUND-abort. We target a
//! MID-CHAIN producer link (NOT the terminal pass) so it has BOTH a live retained
//! copy AND an already-enqueued consumer inject when it aborts.
//!
//! THE TWO TEETH (manager's (A-scoped) bar; (b)/(c) cite alpha's 8 unit tests):
//!   (a) NO device UAF — the retained copy is freed strictly-AFTER the consumer's
//!       inject drains. PROVED by running THIS test under compute-sanitizer:
//!         compute-sanitizer --tool memcheck --error-exitcode 1 \
//!           cargo test -p pie-bin --features driver-cuda --test cuda_overlap23 \
//!           -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//!       A clean sanitizer exit IS the (a) proof (no UAF on the deferred-free).
//!   (d) the consumer CASCADE-ABORTS — the producer-fault poison surfaces to the
//!       guest as an ABORT INDICATION (an error from `await_commit`/`output()`),
//!       NEVER silently committed as a token and never a silently-truncated stream
//!       that looks like normal completion. Asserted host-side below.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`, driver-cuda. See the compute-sanitizer wrapper above for (a).
