//! The measurement loop: one resident model, many rounds, load restarted each
//! time.
//!
//! The shape of this module is the conclusion of `.wiki/plan/config-optimize.md`
//! §5. An earlier design booted a process per candidate, which works and is even
//! fast — 1.03 s for a 1.4 GiB model — right up until the model is the size that
//! makes tuning worth doing, at which point a candidate costs minutes and the
//! whole approach has a model-size ceiling.
//!
//! So the expensive thing happens once. What restarts per round is the load,
//! which is milliseconds, and the knobs move in between through
//! `scheduler::reconfigure`.
//!
//! That ordering is also what makes the reconfigure legal: it refuses while any
//! guest is live, because `model.frame-size()` is cached for the life of a
//! program and a value already handed out cannot be recalled. A round that ends
//! by draining its lanes leaves exactly the state the next round needs.
