# Project Venus — frame-native driver execution

**Thesis.** Make the *frame* (k consecutive forward steps, sealed as one unit)
the conceptual GPU forward-pass unit end to end. The frame crosses the driver
ABI. Inside the driver it is an **amortization unit for host cost** — prepare
once, settle once — **not an execution unit**: execution stays per-step graph
replay, enqueued ahead of the GPU. Goals: maximize throughput in the regime
where the GPU is faster than the host, and *simplify* — the design must delete
more machinery than it adds.

## Why (measured)

Today every step pays the full host pipeline (begin/pull_validate → resolve →
compose → plan → h2d → enqueue → settle). At k=1, 2048×32:
`settlement_enqueue` is 65% of driver-lane host time; the GPU shadow of these
per-wave host lines is the 100µs–1ms compute-gap class ≈ **24% of wall**. M2
(settlement deferral) proved this cannot be fixed by *moving* bookkeeping while
keeping the per-wave structure: per-wave publication forces per-wave sync, and
the next wave's `begin` waits on the prior wave's `publications_done`. The
structure itself must change.

## The model: two decoupled tracks

**Enqueue track (host, sole producer).** Processes sealed frames in order:
frame prepare (validate once, admit once against frame-union demand, plan once,
write all k per-step parameter blocks into the pinned staging ring), then
enqueue k× (H2D → graph replay → publication ops). This track **never waits on
the GPU** — no completion waits, no event waits. Its only backpressure is
staging capacity (ring sized in frames, ≥2).

**Completion track (one callback per frame).** Latches k step outcomes,
terminal cells, completion notify, `cuda_settled`, fences, arena/lease return.
Feeds back into resource accounting only. It **never gates the enqueue track**.

The stream serializes everything: `H2D_i → replay_i → publish_i → H2D_{i+1} → …`
across step *and frame* boundaries alike. On the stream, a frame boundary is
nothing — consecutive ops. The boundary exists only on the host tracks.

## Principles

- **P1 — The frame is a closed system.** Step i+1 observes step i only through
  device state (DecodeEnvelope token feedback, on-stream channel writes). The
  host observes execution only at frame boundaries. This dissolves the two
  couplings that killed M2: the `publications_done` → `begin` wait (k× → 1×,
  overlapped with the previous frame) and per-wave commit-word volatility.

- **P2 — No whole-frame capture.** Reuse today's per-step graph exec cache and
  the staging-ring → persistent-slab H2D machinery as-is. Queuing step n+1's
  replay while step n runs is sufficient and already stream-legal; what blocks
  it today is only the host loop. This kills the {R,k} capture lattice, the
  mixed-frame (prefill+decodes) exception, and any new capture surface — a
  mixed frame is just heterogeneous step bodies enqueued in order.

- **P3 — Publication streams, settlement batches.** Per-step data publication
  (epilogue, commit-bump, frame-carrier D2H mirror, doorbell) stays on-stream,
  fire-and-forget — token streaming latency is unchanged. Only control
  settlement (outcomes, notify, fences) moves to the frame tail. This keeps
  §6.2's guarantee without its sync.

- **P4 — Stream work is SUCCESS-only.** Every per-lane recoverable failure is
  caught at guest submit or engine admission (audit Q1). Mid-frame RETRY is
  made vacuous by admission: `validate_frame`'s device-ring arm bounds the
  whole frame's publication backlog, and frame-union admission reserves all k
  steps' pages up front. Batch-scoped FAILED is synchronous at post time,
  before enqueue. Hence frames are **atomic** (all-or-nothing), one completion
  each, and enqueue-ahead across frames can never need un-doing.

- **P5 — Host waits are severed, not tuned.** Three specific breaks:
  (1) `begin` no longer waits `publications_done` — stream order replaces host
  observation; (2) the depth gate counts *staging capacity*, not in-flight
  completions; (3) settle occupies the lane once per frame, not per wave.

- **P6 — k=1 is wire-identical.** A 1-slot frame degenerates to today's wave.
  Existing oracle dumps remain the regression floor at every k.

## The bubble-freedom inequality

The GPU never idles iff, for every frame k+1:

```
T_prepare(frame) + k·T_enqueue(step)  <  k·T_gpu(step)
```

Current numbers: T_prepare ≈ 2–3 ms (today's per-wave host cost, paid once per
frame), T_enqueue ≈ tens of µs, T_gpu ≈ 5–7 ms at 256-lane decode. k=1
satisfies it with one step of slack (today's 24% gap class is that slack's
jitter, measured); **k is the knob that buys slack** as GPUs get faster
relative to hosts. This inequality is the design's load-bearing invariant.

## The arrival contract

The standing assumption — *frame n+1 has always arrived while frame n runs* —
is a three-party contract, not something the runtime can prove:

- **Guest**: keeps a run-ahead window ≥ 2 FRAMES (= 2k fires) in flight per
  lane (`submit_ahead`, window = 2k). The unit is frames, not fires: frames
  settle atomically, so results arrive only at frame boundaries — a 2-fire
  window at k ≥ 2 is a single frame and drains the pipe every boundary
  (measured: k=2 28k → 34.4k when the window became two frames).
- **Engine**: seals early (while the current frame executes) and posts the
  sealed frame immediately — posting is decoupled from retirement.
- **Driver**: prepare + enqueue fits inside k·T_gpu (the inequality).

A breach (slow lane delaying the quorum, generation-boundary churn) is a
**bubble, not a bug** — correctness is held by stream order regardless. Make
breaches observable: one counter for "enqueue horizon caught by execution".
Boundary churn remains the orthogonal lifecycle track.

## ABI (v14 — one jump, one path)

`PieFrameDesc`: shared invariants (instance set, page translation, base
geometry, channel accesses) + k per-step sections (position/kv_len advance,
write-target step; step 0 may carry prefill payloads — multimodal side-channels
ride the step that owns them). Per-step indptr/last-page arrays are derived
arithmetically at frame prepare — sealed frames make step geometry pure
arithmetic. The ABI changes **once**: v14 is the delta form from day one; the
driver expands internally where today's structures are still consumed.

**Single path.** `LaunchFrame` is the *only* submission unit engine-side. A
1-slot frame is today's wave (P6), so there is no legacy launch path to keep:
remote and TP>1 are served by a thin **decomposition adapter** at the driver
interface edge (frame → per-step posts), never by a second scheduler path.
Admission folds into the frame post itself (reply carries EXHAUSTED /
IMPOSSIBLE) — the `prepare`/`launch_prepared` entry points and the whole lease
registry are deleted. Elastic-pool trim rule: never below the enqueue
horizon's committed targets (trim at horizon-empty points only).

## Closed decisions

1. **Single path** — one scheduler path, adapter at the edge (above).
2. **One ABI jump** — v14 delta form directly; no interim array-of-descs.
3. **Step = ordered homogeneous sub-batches**, computed at frame prepare.
   Mixed geometry classes within a step (fleet lanes at different phases)
   become sequential enqueues, never a fallback path and never a host wait.
4. **The snapshot/commit-word ring is the one new mechanism.** The
   `publications_done` → `begin` wait is a buffer-reuse hazard (pull_validate
   rewrites the per-instance snapshot slot the prior step's publication still
   reads); sever it by ringing those slots to the enqueue-horizon depth
   (frames-in-flight × k). Design this one carefully; everything else deletes.
5. **RETRY vacuity is a build gate.** Enumerate every path that leaves a
   lane's commit word unbumped and prove each is admission-bounded before
   relying on P4. Provable → makeup replay, retry-auto-flush, and the
   force-retry battery are deleted *in the same change*. Any unprovable edge
   degrades to whole-frame atomic RETRY (re-post) — still one mechanism.
6. **Both dormant levers die**: ABI v13 `settle_defer` (structurally
   superseded) and the prefill graph-capture lever (`PIE_PREFILL_GRAPH_*`,
   negative economics). Git remembers.
7. **Cancel resolves at frame boundaries** (posted frames are atomic; today's
   semantics already never cancel posted fires). Watchdog budgets re-scope ×k.
   Fire-timing schema becomes frame-scoped events + the bubble counter.
8. **k stays config-constant** (default 1 until earned). The default flips
   to 2 only when k>1 meets or beats k=1 on the canonical shapes — gated on
   the second landing's prepare hoisting. Dynamic k additionally waits for
   the bubble counter (production instrumentation of the inequality).

## What gets deleted

The entire M2 apparatus (ABI v13 `settle_defer`, park/drain/arm accumulator,
retry-auto-flush, `FlushSettle`, group-aware depth gate), the
`prepare`/`launch_prepared` lease surface and its double batch build, the
engine's wave-level makeup ordering and `wave_outstanding` chaining gate, the
prefill graph-capture lever, and the whole-frame-capture idea. The
frame-native path must end net-negative in mechanism count.

## RETRY audit — gate #5 result (closed)

Exhaustive: `pass_commit` has exactly four writers — the seed (:= 1 at stage
setup), `k_stage_readiness` (ANDs two conditions), and the two compose
fail-stop kills. `entry.poison` is never set at stream settle (M2 entry
audit Q1), so every uncommitted lane classifies as RETRY today. Root sources
and Venus disposition:

- **S1 — ring full** (`k_stage_readiness` need-empty): statically vacuous —
  `validate_frame`'s §5 device-ring arm bounds the whole frame's publication
  backlog at admission. Proven, landed, tested.
- **S2 — consume not ready** (need-full): only reachable when a producer→
  consumer pair lands in one batch (or cascades from an upstream kill).
  Frame prepare orders sub-batches so visible dependencies precede their
  consumers; anything residual takes decision #5's backstop — **whole-frame
  atomic RETRY** (re-post), no per-lane makeup. Zero organic retries across
  every cert to date says the backstop is practically dead code.
- **S3 — compose chain-kill** (`compose_fixed_decode` /
  `compose_decode_envelopes` device-side geometry validation): deterministic
  — a retry re-derives the same state and kills again; today's RETRY
  classification for kills is a misclassification absorbed by the retry
  budget. Venus reclassifies kills as per-lane **FAILED** at frame settle,
  loud. Requires a per-lane kill bit alongside the commit word — folded into
  the decision-#4 snapshot-ring entry (still the one new mechanism).

Consequence: the per-lane RETRY class, makeup replay, retry budgets, and the
force-retry battery all delete; the settle callback classifies
committed → SUCCESS, killed → FAILED (S3 kill word). The S2 whole-frame
re-post backstop was NOT built — the landed form is stricter: a surviving
RETRY terminal is a host staging-contract violation and fails loudly. Zero
organic retries across every certification says re-post is dead weight;
reviving it would be elegance in reverse. This supersedes the backstop
clause above.

## Build strategy — north star, no interim milestones

Build the end state directly; certify once; then tune. No incrementally
landed, individually certified half-forms — dead code is removed in the same
change that obsoletes it, and no compatibility levers are left behind.

Construction order (one landing, bottom-up): ABI v14 → driver frame pipeline
(`frame prepare / step enqueue / frame settle` as modules, replacing the
`handle_fire_batch` monolith zones) → engine frame posting (worker posts
`LaunchFrame`; `frame.rs` reduces to the seal policy: quorum, truncation,
arrival) → edge adapter (remote/TP) → deletions → certification.

Certification campaign (single, at the end): engine units green; **token
streams EXACT vs today's oracle dumps at k∈{1,2,3}** (semantics are unchanged
— tokens are the non-circular regression floor; the byte-exact *wire* floor is
deliberately re-baselined once, since v14 changes the wire by design);
2048-fleet certs at every k; zero watchdog; bubble counter reported. Then the
refine phase: profile, close bubbles, tune horizon depth.

## First landing — what actually carried the weight (measured)

The first landing (2026-07-24, certified) delivered the ABI, the single
path, frame atomicity, the deletions, and S3 — but NOT the prepare-once
enqueue track. It didn't need to: the measured per-step host blocks were
two pool-depth defects (a 2-slot plan-staging ring; pageable transient
uploads), fixed by sizing every per-step staging pool from the run-ahead
depth, and the real k>1 bottleneck was the GUEST window measured in fires
instead of frames (arrival contract, above). Consequence: per-step submit
is non-blocking today, k∈{2..4} sits 3–6% under k=1 (boundary
quantization), and prepare hoisting moved from perf-critical to
future-proofing — which is what the second landing is for.

## Second landing — future-proofing (committed design)

The first landing satisfies the inequality because T_gpu (~5–7 ms) dwarfs
per-step host prep. Next-generation GPUs and TPU-class backends shrink
T_gpu and may lack device-side geometry composition entirely; the second
landing makes the frame abstraction carry that future. Dependency spine:
(1) → (2) → (3) → default k=2; (4) is a parallel backend track; (5)–(8)
are independent.

1. **Frame-prepare hoisting** (the deferred core of the two-track model).
   Split the `handle_fire_batch` monolith into `FramePrepare` (all k
   steps' host work — validation, compose, plan, parameter blocks written
   into a per-step pinned staging ring at frame entry, when nothing of
   this frame is enqueued and there is nothing to wait on) /
   `StepEnqueue` (kernel-launch-only) / `FrameSettle`. This amortizes
   T_prepare once per frame — the only structural lever left when T_gpu
   shrinks — and reduces the backend contract to "consume a prepared
   per-step parameter block": Metal/TPU ports swap the execute half only.
   **LANDED** (second landing round 1, certified at full parity: k=1 fast
   band held, k∈{2..4} bands held, oracles token-exact). Two facts the
   landing surfaced, now part of the design: (a) **the window law** —
   registry sequence applies are the enqueue track's clock and must run
   at each wave's enqueue position in wave order; FramePrepare-time
   consumers read the wave's window from its TICKETS (flag-free tickets
   carry positions for read-only channels), never from live mirrors.
   (b) The attention-plan hook stays at StepEnqueue for now: FlashInfer
   fuses plan compute with the H2D commit into the single stable int
   workspace (a graph-replay invariant), and plan_info is one mutable
   host struct — the clean lift is a model-layer per-step plan snapshot.
   Intra-frame decode steps have IDENTICAL static plans (same R, length-
   independent schedule), so the end state is **plan-once-per-frame**, a
   strictly better form than plan-per-step hoisting; it is the follow-up
   item here. APPROVED conditional on being a side-effect-free pure
   upgrade: the skip predicate is structural identity of every plan
   input (verified by content comparison at prepare, within one frame
   only), never a heuristic; certification gate is token-exact oracles +
   band parity.
2. **Depth gate = staging capacity** (completes P5(2)). Backpressure
   becomes "is there a free prepare slot", severing the last
   completion-count coupling from the enqueue track; horizon depth scales
   without retuning. **CLOSED BY MEASUREMENT** (second landing): the
   depth dose-response re-run on the hoisted build reproduces N9 —
   depth 2 beats depth 3 at BOTH k=1 (35.5 vs 35.2) and k=2 (34.4 vs
   34.0). The gate is not capacity-limited (staging never starves it);
   it is staleness-limited — shallower horizons form fresher batches.
   A capacity-derived gate would push the horizon toward 3 frames and
   regress a measured optimum. The correct standing relation is the one
   already in place: the engine's admission depth is the measured
   policy, and driver staging capacity derives FROM it (runahead.hpp
   single-sourcing). Re-open only if a future backend's bubble evidence
   shows the enqueue horizon starving.
3. **Bubble counter + frame-scoped fire-timing** (completes decision 7).
   One counter — "enqueue horizon caught by execution" — is the
   production instrumentation of the inequality and the prerequisite for
   dynamic k.
4. **Arithmetic delta-form step geometry.** Derive per-step
   indptr/last-page arrays arithmetically at frame prepare (the ABI
   clause above, unexercised in the first landing). This is the TPU path:
   a backend without DecodeEnvelope-style device composition still gets
   k-step frames from host arithmetic — device resolution becomes an
   optimization, not a requirement. Shrinks the wire as a side effect.
   SCOPE CLARIFICATION (second landing): this applies ONLY to the
   arithmetic-advance class (standard append-only decode, whose write
   targets the admission-leased envelope — data-independent). Data-
   dependent geometry (beam fork/freeze WSlot/WOff, device masks) is
   exactly what device composition exists for and is NOT host-derivable;
   on a backend without device composition such programs run k=1 frames.
   **DEFERRED by operator decision**: the guest-facing surface exposure
   is not wanted now, and no current backend needs the arithmetic path —
   revisit with the first TPU-class backend.
5. **True ordered sub-batches** (completes decision 3). The engine today
   emits the degenerate one-sub-batch-per-step form; packing mixed
   geometry classes as ordered sub-batches within one step restores
   "step = the model's forward step" and fixes step count at k for
   heterogeneous fleets. PRECISE CURRENT CONSTRAINT (verified): kernel
   selection already has the right shape — the ragged (prefill) kernel
   is the default and the decode kernel is a pure-decode/no-custom-mask
   optimization; wire batches mix prefill+decode freely. What does NOT
   mix is geometry CLASS at step formation: "wave batches are geometry-
   class homogeneous" (worker.rs) — wire-geometry and device-resolved
   fires launch as separate steps, so at k>1 a prefilling lane cannot
   share a step with chained-decode lanes. The driver's envelope compose
   already supports mixed steps (passthrough lanes); the fixed/graph
   path stays all-envelope (a mixed step is not pure decode, so it was
   never graph-eligible). **APPROVED — in progress** (second landing).
6. **Elastic reclaimable-donor pool.** A resize returns logical budget
   immediately but keeps pages mapped; the pool physically reclaims donor
   pages only under allocation pressure. Kills the gen-boundary
   map↔unmap oscillation; capacity ops become pure bookkeeping at steady
   state.
7. **Native frame wire form for remote.** The edge adapter currently
   decomposes frames into per-step posts; carrying the frame across the
   wire lets remote drivers do frame-union admission — the
   disaggregated-serving shape of the same thesis.
8. **Watchdog budgets re-scope ×k** (decision 7 hygiene).
