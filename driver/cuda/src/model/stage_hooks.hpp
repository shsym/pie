// BY the call: the fire's KV geometry, the scores the layer just captured,
// and the destination a page-mask sink may write. A hook that is handed its
// sideband cannot read another fire's, which is the property the
// thread-locals only approximated — and per-lane hooks (a lane keeping the
// fused path while its neighbour taps scores) are only expressible when the
// binding is an argument rather than ambient state.
