// Declared-forward executor for the llama_like family (Stage 3,
// pie-application-plan.md §7): walk the traced form the `forward/` crate
// produced at model load and launch the SAME kernels, on the SAME workspace
// buffers, that `llama_like_forward_paged`'s unfused path launches. Nothing
// here generates a kernel — op→kernel selection is this driver's knowledge,
// exactly as `contract.hpp` states for the loader's specs.
//
// Scope: the hand-written path's full kernel vocabulary, reached through
// two emitter peepholes over the deliberately-unfused trace:
//   * RmsnormPerHead x2 + Rope → `launch_qk_rmsnorm_rope_bf16`, the
//     hand-written `fuse_qk_norm_rope` branch;
//   * Matmul(qkv) + SplitQkv + RmsnormPerHead x2 + Rope + KvAppend →
//     `launch_qkv_decode_qk_norm_rope_write_kv_bf16`, the hand-written
//     `fused_decode_qkv_post` branch, under the SAME predicate (including
//     the PIE_CUDA_DECODE_FUSED_POST gate).
// Bit-parity requires the same launches, not just the same math — the
// fused kernels round differently from their unfused sequences.
// Everything the trace cannot express yet (hooks, custom masks, TP,
// vision, quantized projections, non-standard rope, post-norm, qkv bias,
// padded head_dim) falls back to `llama_like_forward_paged` — the caller
// gates, `build` refuses.
//
// Explicit KV-write descriptors ARE handled (the hand-written
// `has_write_desc` branch, verbatim): every pure-decode fire that replays a
// forward graph carries them — `forward_graph_replay_eligible` REQUIRES
// `has_write_desc` (batch/forward.cpp) because pure-decode captures record
// the w_page/w_off write path — so excluding them would exclude decode
// entirely and reduce Stage 3's parity claim to the prefill step.
