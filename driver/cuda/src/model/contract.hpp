/// The toolkit a model family uses to state what it binds.
///
/// A contract is the *program* half of `plan = compile(source_facts, program,
/// target)`. It names every tensor this driver wants and gives, for each, an
/// expression over the checkpoint's tensors that produces it. The loader
/// type-checks the expression against what the files actually contain, lowers
/// it to storage instructions, and schedules them; it does not decide *what* to
/// build. That is why a family the loader has never heard of loads exactly as
/// well as one it has (`loader/architecture.md` §12 row 12).
///
/// This header is the mechanism and nothing else. The knowledge — that Phi-3
/// ships a fused QKV, that Kimi hides the decoder under `language_model.`, that
/// GPT-OSS wants Marlin-repacked MXFP4 groups — lives in each family's own
/// directory next to its forward pass, and reaches the loader through the
/// `author_contract` hook on that family's `ArchEntry` row. One row, one
/// `model_type`, one statement of what the family binds and how it is bound.
///
/// It is CUDA's. Metal authors its own contract in
/// `driver/metal/src/model/qwen3_5/`, because a contract is what *this driver*
/// will bind, and the two drivers bind different things: Metal renames every
/// tensor for MLX's binder, fuses nothing, and has no tensor parallelism. A
/// header shared between them made each carry the other's vocabulary.
///
/// Everything here reads two things and nothing else: the checkpoint's tensor
/// table (`pie_loader::Checkpoint`, the same parse the compile will use) and the
/// config facts the driver already parsed. Neither is a second reading of
/// anything, which is the point — the arrangement before this had the driver
/// parse `config.json` for its own model and the loader parse it again for the
/// contract, and two readings that can disagree is one too many.
