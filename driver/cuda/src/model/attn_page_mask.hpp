/// hands the backend a per-page keep mask and the layer's attention is expected
/// to honour it. Everything else that crosses this boundary flows model ->
/// dispatch (`AttentionObservation`), and this deliberately flows the same way:
/// the **model body owns the buffer**. The dispatch only fills it.
///
/// That ownership is not a style choice. The mask has to outlive the PTIR stage
/// that produced it -- it is consumed by the decode call that runs *after* the
/// hook returns -- and `execute_declared_phase` frees its own temporaries at
/// scope exit. A dispatch-owned mask would therefore either leak or dangle. The
/// model, which already knows the fire's page geometry and already brackets the
/// layer, has exactly the right lifetime.
