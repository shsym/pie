// `pipeline::Dispatch`: driver-side PTIR stage-program dispatcher —
// a CUDA-FREE façade over the generated runtime (`program_runtime.hpp`). The impl
// + generated/library launch integration live in `dispatch.cu`, so host `.cpp`
// translation units that include `batch/forward.hpp` never pull device code (the
// tier-0 headers only compile under nvcc). This is the driver half of the submission path: the
// executor opens a launch before descriptor resolution, invokes the declared
// model phases at their anatomical hooks, then atomically finishes after
// lm_head. `run()` remains the boundary-stage convenience path used by focused
// tests. Programs arrive as a compiler-built launch package -- there is no plan
// format to decode here -- and instances stay persistent by wire id. Owned once by `pipeline::Registry`
// (`registry.hpp`), which is the single construction site.
