//! Backend-agnostic transport core.
//!
//! Defines the uniform interface every engine implements and the
//! register → transfer → complete lifecycle vocabulary. Engines (`local`,
//! `nixl`) plug in behind the [`Engine`] trait; the [`crate::registry`] binds a

//!
//! The KV handle the data plane consumes lives on the schema floor
//! ([`pie_driver_abi::kv::KvHandle`]) — transport never owns or interprets the
//! bytes, it only moves pages between workers.
