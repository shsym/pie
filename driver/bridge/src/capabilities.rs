//! Driver capability handshake — NOT a rkyv wire type.
//!
//! Each driver advertises its capabilities (page geometry, forward limits,
//! tokenizer arch, etc.) at startup via a JSON blob delivered to the runtime.
//! The runtime parses it into [`DriverCapabilities`] for scheduling and
//! batching decisions. The shape is wire-stable — fields appear verbatim
//! in the driver's ready-callback JSON (see `driver/cuda/src/entry.cpp`,
//! `driver/portable/src/entry.cpp`, `driver/dummy/src/lib.rs`).
//!
//! This is intentionally not under `#[schema]` — the handshake happens
//! once at driver startup and uses JSON over a side channel, not the
//! rkyv ring.
