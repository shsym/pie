// How fast is the llama family, next to mlx-lm?
//
// Every llama test before this one is a correctness test, and the fastest
// possible driver is the one that computes nothing. This is the other half:
// the same executor `pie serve` calls, driven over a real checkpoint, timed.
//
// It measures the two numbers that are not interchangeable:
//
//   * PREFILL -- a whole prompt in ONE fire. Compute-bound, and the only thing
//     that exercises `affine_qmm_t`, so it is where a tiled GEMM either pays
//     for itself or does not.
//   * DECODE -- one token per fire. Memory-bound: at batch one every weight in
//     the model crosses the bus once per token, so the ceiling is bandwidth
//     divided by the size of the weights, and no amount of arithmetic changes
//     it. Reported as a fraction of that ceiling, because tokens per second on
//     its own says more about the machine than about the driver.
//
// The comparison target is mlx-lm on the SAME checkpoint. That is the fair
// version of the question: an mlx-community 4-bit checkpoint is MLX affine-U4,
// which is the format this driver's kernels already read, so neither side is
// paying a conversion the other avoids.
//
// Skipped (not failed) when the checkpoint is absent, like the forward tests.
