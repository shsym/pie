// Generic MoE routing: select experts, group rows by expert, and combine them.
//
// A mixture's problem at prefill is not arithmetic, it is that every (token,
// slot) pair reads a DIFFERENT expert's weight matrix. The matvec form pays
// that literally: `rows * experts_per_token` matvecs, each re-reading a whole
// [N, K] stack slice, so a 512-token prefill reads the same 128 experts four
// thousand times. Nothing about the shape improves with the batch, which is
// exactly what the measurements said -- our routed prefill was flat in length
// where mlx-lm's climbed.
//
// The fix is not a wider kernel. It is to put the rows that share an expert
// NEXT TO EACH OTHER, at which point the projection is an ordinary batched
// matmul over a contiguous block of rows against one weight slice -- the
// `affine_qmm_t` this driver already has. The reordering is:
//
//   sort    -- a counting sort of the (row, slot) pairs by expert id, laid out
//              so each expert's run starts on a tile boundary.
//   gather  -- copy each sorted position's source row into that order.
//
// There is no third kernel putting the results back. The sort emits the INVERSE
// permutation alongside the forward one -- it knows both, at no cost, at the
// moment it places a pair -- and the combine step reads its k slots through it.
// Undoing a permutation to feed a kernel that is about to gather anyway is a
// dispatch and a full-width buffer spent to make an index arithmetic look
// simpler.
//
// Sort and gather also run at M=1. A decode handles eight pairs, which is
// microseconds -- and it means the routed
// dataflow has ONE shape rather than a decode shape and a prefill shape that
// have to be kept agreeing. The batched and unbatched paths differ in exactly
// one number, `tile_rows`: 1 leaves the sort a pure grouping with no padding
// and the projections stay matvecs; 16 rounds every expert's run up to a tile
// and they become matmuls.
