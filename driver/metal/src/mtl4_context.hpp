// mtl4_context.hpp — alpha's Metal-4 wrapper scaffold for the raw-Metal decode path.
//
// Pure-C++ surface (no Obj-C types leak): every lane includes this from plain .cpp/.mm.
// The Metal-4 objects (MTL4CommandQueue / MTLHeap / MTLResidencySet / double-buffered
// MTL4CommandAllocator / MTL4ArgumentTable) live behind a PIMPL in mtl4_context.mm.
//
// Verified boilerplate reference: beta's files/icb-probes/mtl4probe.mm (runtime
// newLibraryWithSource + MTL4Compiler PSO + queue/allocator/argtable/residency/event).
//
// Contract keyed off delta's decode_abi.hpp (Region / IoSlot / bind:: / Kernel).
// Ownership split (manager): delta lays out the heap (region offsets) + ports kernels;
// beta encodes the per-step command buffer + replay; alpha owns these wrappers + harness.
//
// ── Toolchain reality (this box) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//   No offline `metal`/`metallib` compiler is installed (CommandLineTools only, no Xcode).
//   So shaders are compiled at RUNTIME via [MTLDevice newLibraryWithSource:] + MTL4Compiler.
//   The CMake AOT `.metal`->`.metallib` path is gated on the toolchain being present
//   (PIE_RAW_METAL_AOT, default OFF). Runtime compile is the de-risked Phase-0 path.
