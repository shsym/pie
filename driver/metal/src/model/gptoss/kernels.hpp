/// The launch shapes come from the sources' index contracts, not from another
/// family's equivalents. Two are worth stating up front:
///
///  * The matvec is `qmv_dispatch`'s shape -- grid `{32, N/4, 1}`, tg
///    `{32,2,1}` -- with a THIRD grid axis for the routed variants, one plane
///    per selected expert. gemma4's bring-up wrote its own matvec shape and got
///    a grid whose x was one thread wide, so half of every output was never
///    written; this reuses the shared helper for exactly that reason.
///  * The router's 8-bit matvec is one simdgroup per output row.
