// decode_dispatch_mb.hpp — beta's M>1 launch-geometry helpers (multi-batch lane).
//
// The N>1 generalization of decode_dispatch.hpp. Pie's batch dim is N=total_tokens; the
// raw-Metal activations are token-major [N, feature], so every per-row kernel just stacks N
// rows on the batch axis. KEY INSIGHT (quantized_qmv.metal): affine_qmv_fast ALREADY batches
// over tid.x (`x += tid.x*in_vec_size; y += tid.x*out_vec_size`) — the M=1 path launches with
// 1 threadgroup in x. So an M>1 batched GEMV is just `grid.x *= N`, BIT-EXACT by construction
// (each row reproduces the M=1 accumulation) and reducing to the shipped path at N=1. No new
// GEMM kernel is needed for CORRECTNESS; the tiled affine_qmm (weight reuse across rows) is a
// PERF lever layered on AFTER the parity gate is green.
//
// Pure (no Metal types beyond Grid/Threadgroup). dispatchThreads semantics: Grid = TOTAL
// THREADS, tg = threads/threadgroup, threadgroups = ceil(Grid/tg) per axis (matches
// decode_dispatch.hpp + RawMetalContext::dispatch).
