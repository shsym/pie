//
// The N>1 generalization of decode_dispatch.hpp. Pie's batch dim is N=total_tokens; the
// raw-Metal activations are token-major [N, feature], so every per-row kernel just stacks N
// rows on the batch axis. KEY INSIGHT (quantized_qmv.metal): affine_qmv_fast ALREADY batches
// over tid.x (`x += tid.x*in_vec_size; y += tid.x*out_vec_size`) — the M=1 path launches with
// 1 threadgroup in x. So an M>1 batched GEMV is just `grid.x *= N`, BIT-EXACT by construction
// (each row reproduces the M=1 accumulation) and reducing to the shipped path at N=1. No new
// GEMM kernel is needed for CORRECTNESS; the tiled affine_qmm (weight reuse across rows) is a
// PERF lever layered on AFTER the parity gate is green.
//
// Pure (no Metal types beyond Grid/Threadgroup). dispatchThreads semantics: Grid = TOTAL
// THREADS, tg = threads/threadgroup, threadgroups = ceil(Grid/tg) per axis (matches
// decode_dispatch.hpp + RawMetalContext::dispatch).

// Below this batch the GEMV is the faster kernel. The crossover is a property
// of the MACHINE and of whether the checkpoint's FFN is routed -- see
// `device_tuning.hpp`. It was measured on an M1 Max, where pie's per-step cost
// beats mlx-lm's at every batch up to 8 with the GEMV and only loses above it;
// an M2 Max and an M4 Pro both move the DENSE crossover down to 8 and an
// unrecognised device still gets the 12 this constant was.
//
// Passed in rather than asked for here, which is the whole point: the value is
// not known until there is a device to ask AND a geometry to ask about, and
// this header has neither.
// The ported steel GEMM is instantiated aligned-only, at BM=16 and BK=32. K is
// not checked: every qwen3.6 projection has K % 512 == 0 (the same fact the
// GEMV port relies on for its "fast" variant), so K % BK == 0 is free.
// Rows per threadgroup.  The GEMM dequantizes a weight tile once per row
// block, so a batch that spans several blocks pays for the same dequantize
// again in each -- which is why doubling M nearly doubles the time (14.6ms at
// M=16, 24.4 at 32, 45.7 at 64, measured standalone across the checkpoint's
// projections).  A taller block halves that work at the cost of halving the
// threadgroup count, so it is only worth taking once the batch is wide enough
// to have blocks to spare: at M=32, BM=32 measures 20.4ms against BM=16's 24.4.
// The row blocks the GEMM is instantiated for, narrowest first. This is a
// LIST rather than a narrow/wide pair because the argument above does not stop
// at 32: a 128-row prompt at BM=32 still unpacks every weight four times, and
// measured on an M1 Max the third rung is worth as much as the second was --
// llama-1B prefills 1236 tok/s at BM=16, 1616 at 32 and 1936 at 64.
// A fourth rung would need more accumulators per lane than BM=64/BN=32's
// sixteen, which is where the register file stops paying.
//
// The other three axes were swept at this rung and none of them moved, so the
// list is where the tuning is:
//   BK=64  is SLOWER (1647 vs 1817 on llama-1B) and illegal below gs=64 --
//          QuantizedBlockLoader asserts BCOLS <= group_size, so a gs=32
//          checkpoint cannot compile it at all.
//   WM=4   is SLOWER (1714). Splitting a 64-row block four ways puts each lane
//          back to sixteen accumulators, and it does not help: the 32 that
//          WM=2 spends are not what the kernel is short of.
//   BN=32  is slower than 64 at this rung, so `qmm_bn`'s argument survives.
