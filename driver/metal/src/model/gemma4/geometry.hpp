/// the defaults. Everything here is runtime state: the driver used to compile
/// one checkpoint's shape into the type, and that is what stopped a second
/// family from loading at all.
///
/// Three things make this family's shape different from qwen3.5's, and all
/// three are in the schedule rather than the kernels:
///
///  * **head_dim is per attention type.** Sliding layers use `head_dim`; full
///    layers use `global_head_dim`. So are the RoPE base frequency and the
///    partial-rotary factor.
///  * **The tail of the stack shares KV.** The last `num_kv_shared_layers`
///    layers re-attend the most recent earlier layer of the SAME attention
///    type; they have no k/v projections of their own (`mlx_lm`'s
///    `gemma4_text.py` does not even construct them).
///  * **The MLP doubles over exactly that range** (`use_double_wide_mlp`).
