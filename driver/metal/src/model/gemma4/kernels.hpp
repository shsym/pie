/// Gemma 4's kernel PSOs and launch geometry.
///
/// Six `.metal` files shipped with this family's bring-up and had no PSO entry,
/// no `bind::` enum and no host-side params mirror — they compiled and nothing
/// could reach them. This is the other half.
///
/// The launch shapes come from the sources, not from qwen3.5's equivalents:
/// `vnorm_single_row` is one threadgroup per row like `rms_single_row`, but
/// `geglu_tanh` / `logit_softcap` / `layer_scalar_mul` / `ple_combine` are flat
/// elementwise `dispatchThreads` grids, which is why they take a plain `n`.
