// MetalExecutor — the forward seam between Context's PTIR launch path and
// the native Metal decode pipeline (metal_ptir_plan.md §5.1, D1: MetalExecutor
// backs it, not the MLX ops path). Deliberately narrow: `context.cpp` never
// includes MetalExecutor or any Metal/ObjC header directly — it owns one
// `std::unique_ptr<MetalExecutor>`, created lazily on the first
// forward-needing launch, and calls `setup()` / `forward()` through this
// plain-C++ interface only. The implementation is in `forward.cpp`;
// compiled only on Apple; a non-Apple build still links (Linux/CI stub
// builds keep validating the direct-ABI surface) but every call reports a
// clear "requires an Apple build" error instead of silently no-op'ing.
//
// Sealed M=1 scope (ordinary linear member): MetalExecutor holds
// exactly ONE resident linear KV/GDN sequence (the shipped single-stream
// path). `forward()` therefore accepts a fire only if it is either a fresh
// sequence for the SAME (or no) resident sequence (RS_FLAG_RESET / position
// 0), or the exact continuation of the currently resident one (matching
// sequence id, exact next position, and a KV page list that preserves the
// resident one as a prefix — physical page NUMBERING need not be
// arithmetically adjacent, e.g. {5, 9} is valid); anything else (a second
// concurrent sequence, a fork, a shared prefix, out-of-order positions, or
// duplicated pages) is rejected with a precise reason rather than silently
// corrupting state. `validate_linear_sequence_geometry` is the pure
// (host-testable, no Metal dependency) core of that check.
