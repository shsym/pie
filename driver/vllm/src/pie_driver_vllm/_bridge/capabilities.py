"""Driver → runtime handshake contract.

Pie's configuration has two distinct concepts that this module separates:

  * **Budgets** (top-down, user-set in `ModelConfig` / `SchedulerConfig`):
    "you may use up to this much" — `gpu_mem_utilization`, `swap_budget_bytes`,
    `default_token_limit`, scheduler timing knobs, etc. These flow from the
    user's config file into the worker and are consumed there. They never
    come back.

  * **Capacities** (bottom-up, driver-computed in this dataclass): "given
    that budget plus the kernel's real ceiling, here is what I actually
    have" — number of KV pages, page size the attention impl supports,
    forward limits, model-architecture facts read from HF config. These
    flow from the worker back to the server via the `ready_queue` handshake
    and are then forwarded to the Rust runtime when applicable.

Each inference driver (`pie_driver`, `pie_driver_vllm`, future siblings)
implements `Engine.capabilities() -> DriverCapabilities` and the worker
delivers that struct as the ready signal payload. The server uses it as the
source of truth when constructing `pie_runtime.ModelConfig`.

Some fields are forwarded to Rust through existing `pie_runtime.ModelConfig` /
`DeviceConfig` kwargs; others are Python-only for now (used for validation
and logging at the server layer). See server._bootstrap for the wiring.
