//! GPU timestamps that a real step actually wrote.
//!
//! The heap, the mark and the resolve can all succeed while measuring
//! nothing: a heap allocates, an out-of-range mark is undefined rather than
//! reported, and a heap that was never written resolves to a vector of
//! zeroes. So the load-bearing test here is not "resolve returned something"
//! -- it is that a step which dispatches a kernel between two marks produces
//! two NON-ZERO ticks in the order they were encoded.
//!
//! Requires a Metal 4 GPU, and skips without one.
