//! **A real checkpoint's weights, through the generic executor, and what came
//! out.**
//!
//! `device_text_fire.rs` proves the fire executes against sentinels;
//! `device_checkpoint_names.rs` proves every name binds against a checkpoint.
//! Neither looks at a NUMBER, and the gap between them is where a driver hides
//! its worst defects: a fire that runs to completion over correctly-addressed
//! weights and computes nonsense is indistinguishable from a working one
//! unless somebody reads the output.
//!
//! So this reads the output. Not against a reference — that is the accuracy
//! gate's job and it wants one — but against the three failure modes that
//! account for most of the distance:
//!
//!   * **all zeros.** A projection told its extents are zero no-ops; a weight
//!     bound to an unwritten arena slot contributes nothing. Both leave the
//!     residual stream exactly as the embedding left it, or empty.
//!   * **non-finite.** A norm handed a zero epsilon divides by the root of the
//!     mean square alone; a NaN anywhere spreads to everything downstream
//!     within one layer.
//!   * **degenerate.** Every row identical means the per-token axis is not
//!     reaching the kernels — a launch whose grid collapsed, or a gather
//!     reading token 0 for every lane.
//!
//! None of those three is subtle and all three are invisible without a read.
//! Passing here is not correctness; it is the floor beneath which correctness
//! cannot be discussed.
//!
//! It found six defects in its first afternoon, and the last two are the ones
//! that argue for the file:
//!
//!   1. **No barrier between dispatches.** Metal does not order two dispatches
//!      in one compute encoder and the executor's loop emitted none. Three
//!      runs of one fire gave widest activations of 11.7, 23.1 and 4.5e12 --
//!      TWO OF THE THREE looked entirely plausible.
//!   2. **The readout's dtype.** The text said `F32`, `affine_qmv_fast` writes
//!      bfloat, and the logits came back exactly half zero.
//!   3. **Unzeroed arena and KV pool.** A fresh Metal buffer is usually zero
//!      and nothing promises it, so an attention read past what a fire wrote
//!      attended to whatever the allocator last held.
//!   4. **The single-row gather.** `embed_gather_4bit` reads `id[0]` and
//!      writes one row whatever grid it is handed, and the text picked it by
//!      CLASS -- but a decode of four requests is four rows. One readout lane
//!      of four held anything, and NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG: every launch stated
//!      four rows, every grid covered them, and every other kernel read the
//!      row where the grid put it.
//!   5. **Contiguous attention over a paged pool.** The text chose by CLASS
//!      where the POOL's layout decides, so a decode walked
//!      `[page, token, head, dim]` with `sdpa_vector_decode`'s arithmetic.
//!   6. **`v_new` bound to nothing.** `dispatch::reorder` defaulted a row's
//!      output count to ONE, and `kv_append` names no `Out` -- it writes the
//!      POOL. So the last INPUT was taken for an output and `In(1)` had
//!      nothing to resolve to. The K pages filled, the V pages were zero in
//!      every layer, and the attention that read them answered zero without
//!      failing. The widest activation went 1.1 -> 14.75 when it was fixed,
//!      which is the difference between a residual stream and a rumour of
//!      one.
//!
//! Every statement in the first layer writes both rows now, attention
//! included. What is NOT established is that any of the numbers is the right
//! number -- that still wants a reference, and this gate is the floor beneath
//! it rather than a substitute for it.
//!
//! Three measurements track what is left, each pinned so it can only improve:
//! declared outputs nothing fills (**0**, was 5), readout lanes that hold
//! anything (**4** of 4, was 1), and the arena's non-zero share (**99%**, was
//! 26%).
//!
//! Gated on `PIE_METAL_SMOKE_CHECKPOINT`, the same variable the other
//! checkpoint tests take. Run against
//! `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit`.
//!
//! # gpt-oss-20b: it loads now, and it NaNs
//!
//! Measured 2026-08-10 against `mlx-community/gpt-oss-20b-MXFP4-Q4`, which
//! became runnable here the day `stage_plan_weights` stopped holding the
//! model twice (12.1 GB peak; the old path wanted about twice that and this
//! machine has 32 GB).
//!
//! `a_real_checkpoints_weights_produce_finite_varied_activations` **fails**
//! on it: 909,207 NaNs. That is the first numeric result gpt-oss has ever
//! produced here -- every prior gate was structural (names resolve, the fire
//! encodes, the launches are legal grids), and all of those still pass.
//!
//! What the bisection says, which is where anyone picking this up should
//! start: **layer 0 is entirely finite and plausible.** Twelve statements,
//! every one writing both rows, magnitudes from 2.5 to 36, the KV pool
//! holding real keys and values --
//!
//! ```text
//! [ 8] sdpa_paged_decode_sink_bfloat16_d_64   max|v| 10.25
//! [ 9] affine_qmv_fast_residual_...           max|v| 31.25
//! [10] rms_single_row_bfloat16                max|v|  2.51
//! [11] affine_qmv_fast_...  (the router)      max|v|  3.90
//! ```
//!
//! So the attention half is right, the sink kernel runs, and the router is
//! handed a sane activation. The NaN is downstream of statement 11 -- in the
//! six-statement routed FFN (`route_sort`, `route_gather`, two
//! `routed_qmv`, the clamped `swiglu`, `combine_sorted`) or in what a later
//! layer does with its output.
//!
//! Two candidates worth checking first, in order: the SwiGLU's `limit` and
//! `alpha` (gpt-oss clamps the gate above, clamps the linear branch both ways
//! and adds one to it -- a wrong bound there is an overflow, not a rounding
//! error), and the expert bank's row count after the sort pads each group up
//! to a tile.

/// its own. What is left is every piece of arithmetic that is not
/// position-dependent: the gather, five norms a layer, q/k/v/o, the gated MLP,
/// the final norm and the readout.
///
/// The reference is MLX itself, run over the same snapshot with
/// `mx.quantized_matmul` -- the same affine codec the checkpoint was written
/// with, so a disagreement is about the DRIVER and not about who read the
/// 4-bit format correctly. Its answer for `<|begin_of_text|>` (128000) is
/// argmax **16309** with logits spanning [-4.61, 6.41].
///
/// **It agrees.** Same argmax, the same top five in the same order, every
/// logit within bf16 of MLX's, and the same span. The driver's readout is bf16
/// where MLX accumulates wider, so the tolerance is a statement about the
/// FORMAT rather than slack for a wrong answer.
///
/// Getting here cost one more defect, and it was two statements into the fire:
/// `RmsParams::w_stride` is the distance between consecutive CHANNELS of the
/// gain vector -- `ws[w_stride * i]`, one for a contiguous row, and
/// `rms.metal`'s own header says so. The statement passed the AXIS. Every norm
/// read `w[2048 * i]`, strode out of the gain vector on its second channel,
/// and multiplied by whatever followed it in the checkpoint. Channel 1 came
/// out -0.016 where MLX says +0.052: the wrong sign, from the wrong tensor.
///
/// It survived everything. The fire ran, every statement wrote every row, no
/// NaN, no infinity, 99% of the arena non-zero, and the logits were a
/// plausible-looking near-uniform distribution over 128256 tokens. Only a
/// reference could see it, which is the argument for having one.
///
/// # Why position zero and not position one
///
/// Not caution -- a KNOWN gap, and stating where it is beats pretending it is
/// not there. llama-3.2's config carries
/// `rope_scaling: {rope_type: llama3, factor: 32, low_freq_factor: 1,
/// high_freq_factor: 4, original_max_position_embeddings: 8192}`, and the text
/// passes `dsl::metal::rope` a bare theta. So the driver's rotation is the
/// unscaled one and a comparison at any position but zero would be measuring
/// that rather than the executor.
///
/// The shader for it already exists: `rope_neox_freqs_decode` takes
/// `inv_freq` as a device buffer rather than deriving frequencies from a base,
/// which is exactly the shape llama-3's rescaling wants. What is missing is
/// the table -- a load-time derivation from the config, so a `Source` beside
/// the fire tables rather than anything a text can state. That is the next
