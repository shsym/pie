//! What every Metal text must satisfy, checked once and reusable.
//!
//! Four families need texts and one has one. The checks that found the
//! defects in `llama_like`'s were the same four every time, so they are
//! written here **over a `ForwardPlan`** rather than over that one text —
//! a new family gets them by adding three lines to `texts()`, and gets them
//! the moment its first statement exists rather than after it is finished.
//!
//! # What each check caught, so none is deleted for looking obvious
//!
//! | check | what it found in `llama_like` |
//! |---|---|
//! | every symbol has a row | `attn::split_qkv_bf16`, which turned out to need a scalar channel and not a shader |
//! | every row states its file | three rows pointing at files that do not define them |
//! | every symbol is an INSTANTIATED point | four symbols named as bare stems, which resolve in the table and not in any shader |
//! | every launch becomes a legal grid | the `Unstated` rows for the whole batched lane |
//! | every weight name has a spelling | the map assuming HuggingFace naming |
//!
//! Two of those are only findable by *running* — a stem resolves through
//! `sig_in` because the row carries axes, and only the shader disagrees. So
//! this file holds the ones that are answerable on the host, and
//! `tests/device_text_fire.rs` holds the rest.
