//! A real checkpoint, and whether the text's names find it.
//!
//! `model_dispatch.rs` proves every name the text states has a *spelling*.
//! That is a claim about the map. This is the claim about the **checkpoint**:
//! that the spelling names a tensor the plan actually published.
//!
//! The two can disagree, and did. An earlier draft of `Names::mlx` assumed the
//! HuggingFace convention (`model.layers.3.…`, `model.embed_tokens`), was
//! self-consistent, and passed its own test — because both sides of that test
//! were the same file. Only a checkpoint can settle it, so this test exists
//! and is gated on one.
//!
//! Gated on `PIE_METAL_SMOKE_CHECKPOINT`, the same variable `device_smoke.rs`
//! takes. **It has been run.** Against
//! `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit` (372 tensors) every name both
//! fire classes state binds, which is the first claim about this text that a
//! real checkpoint rather than another source file settles.
//!
//! Two defects were between here and that result, and neither was in the name
//! map:
//!
//!   * The gate stated `qwen3_0_6b()` facts against a llama snapshot and
//!     reported 308 missing names -- every one a `qkv` or a `q_norm`, which is
//!     to say the FIXTURE's bindings. It derives facts from the checkpoint
//!     now, through the chain the seam uses.
//!   * `geometry_from_facts` read only the `q35_*` block, so a llama config
//!     -- which `from_descriptor` reads into `ll_*` -- was refused as
//!     "carrying no decoder shape" while carrying it in the other block. And
//!     it demanded a linear-attention block of a stack that has no linear
//!     layers.
