//! The oracle, device half: the GPU against the interpreter, on emitted code.
//!
//! # What this pins
//!
//! `oracle_interp.rs` pins this crate's channel-plane interpreter against
//! `tensor_compiler::eval::interp`, the original golden model, bit for bit.
//! This file closes the other half of `CUTOVER.md`'s gate item 4: the same
//! program run **on the device** must agree with that interpreter.
//!
//! Because the CPU half already holds, diffing the device against
//! `pipeline::step` here is not the weaker claim it would otherwise be — the
//! two comparisons compose, and the device is transitively held to the golden
//! model without this file having to carry a `BoundTrace` through the GPU path.
//!
//! # Emitted kernels, not stand-ins
//!
//! `device_fire.rs` hand-writes MSL that honours the binding ABI, because what
//! it tests is the driver's half of the protocol — readiness, then regions,
//! then commit. That is the right fixture for that question and the wrong one
//! for this one: a hand-written kernel proves nothing about whether the
//! *emitter's* arithmetic matches the interpreter's.
//!
//! So these cases run [`tensor_compiler::codegen::program::emit_program`] with
//! [`Backend::Metal`] — the real generated MSL for the real compiled stages —
//! against the real `LaunchPackage` from the same compile. One trace produces
//! both the thing the GPU runs and the thing the interpreter runs, so a
//! disagreement is a disagreement about semantics.
//!
//! # What this found: one ulp, and only on transcendentals
//!
//! The device and the interpreter agree **exactly** on plain arithmetic, on
//! reductions, and on the argmax tie-break. They disagree by **one ulp on
//! `exp`**: for `exp(0.5)` Rust's `f32::exp` answers `1.6487212` and Metal's
//! answers `1.6487213`. Both are within half an ulp of the true value; neither
//! is wrong. Two libms rounded a transcendental differently, which is what
//! libms do, and no amount of care in this crate closes it.
//!
//! That is why `CUTOVER.md`'s gate item 4 says "within its stated tolerance"
//! where item 3 says bit-identical: the interpreter oracle crosses a libm
//! boundary and the token-exactness gate does not. This file is where the
//! tolerance is stated — one ulp, claimed by the `exp` case alone, with a
//! companion case proving plain arithmetic still costs zero so the bound means
//! something.
//!
//! **The tolerance never applies to a decision.** `same_within` compares
//! integer, index and boolean lanes exactly whatever the tolerance says. A
//! magnitude may be a hair off and still be the same answer; an argmax index or
//! a sort permutation is either the same decision or a different token. The
//! reduction and tie-break cases below therefore run at zero tolerance, and
//! widening the constant cannot reach them.
//!
//! # The versions are read, not written
//!
//! [`Versions`] comes from `tensor_compiler`'s own constants rather than a
//! literal. `PARITY-M1.md`'s `identity.rs` entry is about exactly this: the
//! C++ carried `kMetalM1EmitterVersion = 23` while the host emitter had moved
//! to 36, so the compile-cache key had silently drifted. A test that hardcodes
//! the numbers cannot notice that; one that reads them fails to compile when
//! they move.
