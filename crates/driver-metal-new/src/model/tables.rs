//! A row names which table a slot wants; something has to put them on the
//! device. That was written twice — once at the engine seam and once in
//! `tests/device_real_weights.rs` — and the two drifted the moment the text
//! named a table only one of them knew: the gate held both fire classes to
//! MLX while the seam was still staging seven of nine, so a rotation with no
//! frequency ladder and a readout that answered the first token were invisible
//! from either side.
//!
//! One builder, and the resolver's index map beside it. What a caller supplies
//! is the FRAME's data; what this owns is the order.
