//! Which text the loaded checkpoint is.
//!
//! # Selecting is not choosing
//!
//! "Nothing in the driver may choose a kernel" is the crate's governing rule,
//! and a reader could mistake this module for a breach of it. It is not, and
//! the distinction is worth stating precisely because it will be reached for
//! again when the other three families land.
//!
//! A *choice* is the driver deciding what to run. What happens here is a
//! **lookup**: the checkpoint states its architecture, and this answers with
//! the text written for it. Nothing about which kernels fire is decided here —
//! the text names every symbol, the lowering flattens it, and the executor
//! walks the result. Remove this module and the same kernels would run; you
//! would simply have no way to say which model you loaded.
//!
//! The test is the one `metal.md` gives for the whole crate: *does removing it
//! change which kernels fire?* It does not.
//!
//! # Why the driver and not the engine
//!
//! It could sit in the seam instead. It sits here because running the model it
//! loaded is the driver's job, and because `driver-cuda-new`'s shell does the
//! same in `pie_cuda_launch` for the same reason. A seam that selected texts
//! would have to know every family, and it would learn a new one every time a
//! driver did.
