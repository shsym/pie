//! Running a fire: the four calls, in one place.
//!
//! Everything under `model/` is a step of one walk, and this is the walk:
//!
//! ```text
//! rows_of(step)          the frame's rows          model::frame
//! lower(plan, rows)      rows -> rectangles        model-compiler
//! plan(lowered, ..)      rectangles -> grids       model::dispatch
//! encode(dispatches)     grids -> a command buffer model::encode
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything either. It allocates the arena the lowering
//! asked for, stages the scalars the statements state, compiles the symbols
//! they name, and runs them in order.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! The KV pool, the paged translation and the completion broker. Those are the
//! frame's device half and they belong with the module that owns the buffers —
//! this one owns only the arena, which is the lowering's own number.
