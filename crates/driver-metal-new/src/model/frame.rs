//! The frame bridge: a sealed frame's step becomes `&[Row]`.
//!
//! `DriverBackend::launch` hands over a frame — a lane roster, a KV page
//! translation, an admission high-water and an ordered list of steps. The
//! lowering wants a [`ForwardPlan`] and `&[Row]`. Everything between them is
//! what `forward.cpp` did, and **`forward.cpp` is not being ported**: it is
//! the family executor, and the lowering replaces it. What survives is the
//! frame questions it answered, and this is where they get their new answers.
//!
//! # The region table already answered the hard one
//!
//! The plan called this "the largest unknown, and the only piece with no
//! predecessor to read". Most of that turned out to be true of the *device*
//! half. The row half has a predecessor after all, and it is not in the C++:
//! **tart rung ③'s region table**, which the scheduler already computes and
//! the ABI already carries.
//!
//! A region is a run of rows sharing an axis bitset (`PIE_REGION_SIG_*`) and a
//! depth (`region_k`). A [`Row`] is a request's feature point on exactly those
//! axes. So the mapping is a bit-for-bit read, not a derivation:
//!
//! | region bit | row field |
//! |---|---|
//! | `MULTI_TOKEN` | `multi_token` |
//! | `HOOK`, `HOOK_PAGE_MASK` | `hooked` |
//! | `MASK` | `custom_mask` |
//! | `TRUNCATED` | `depth_k = Some(region_k)` |
//! | `LORA` | `lora` |
//!
//! and the region table's row runs are the *seriation* — which is what the
//! polymorphism guards need, since a text that splits on an axis requires that
//! axis's rows be contiguous. The two tasks meet here, exactly as planned.
//!
//! # When the table is empty
//!
//! An empty region table is the legacy discipline: no seriation was run, so
//! every row is the same point. That is not a refusal — it is a fire of one
//! region covering everything, which is precisely the monomorphic case the
//! Metal text serves today.
//!
