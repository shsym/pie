//! The ported kernels take geometry constants — norm epsilons, projection
//! K/N, rope base, SDPA strides — that no other lane binds: not the weight
//! registry, not the scratch schedule, not the KV/state/IO binds. The
//! argument tables are address-only (no `setBytes`), so an unbound
//! `constant&` argument is a GPU fault, not a compile error; this module is

//! (`kernels-metal/kernels/{norm/rms_params.h, moe/params.h,

//! `static_assert`s.
