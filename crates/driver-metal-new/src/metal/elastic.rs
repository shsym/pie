//! A buffer whose address never moves and whose memory comes and goes.
//!
//! The KV cache is the problem this exists for. Its size is not known when
//! the model loads -- it depends on how many sequences arrive and how long
//! they get -- and the obvious answers are both wrong. Allocating for the
//! worst case reserves tens of gigabytes that are usually idle, on a machine
//! where the GPU and the CPU are competing for the same DRAM. Reallocating
//! as it grows changes the buffer's GPU address, and the address is baked
//! into argument tables, into constant blocks, and into every kernel that
//! walks the cache by pointer.
//!
//! A placement-sparse buffer separates the two. The buffer is created once at
//! its full virtual size, so its `gpuAddress` is fixed for its lifetime and
//! nothing that recorded it ever has to be told. Physical memory is attached
//! and detached underneath in [`TILE`]-sized pieces, and only the attached
//! part costs anything.
//!
//! # Three sizes, and they are all different
//!
//! * [`TILE`] (16 KiB) is the sparse page: the granularity Metal will map at,
//!   and therefore what every offset and length here is rounded to.
//! * [`CHUNK`] (256 MiB) is the placement heap: the granularity physical
//!   memory is *acquired* at. Mapping a tile needs a heap to take it from,
//!   and a heap per tile would be tens of thousands of heaps.
//! * [`PAGE`] (2 MiB) is neither. It is the unit the budget is *reported* in,
//!   shared with the CUDA driver so the two agree on what a number means.
//!
//! Confusing the first two is the bug this layout is arranged to prevent: the
//! chunk is what gets allocated and freed, the tile is what gets mapped and
//! unmapped, and a chunk is released only once every tile in it is unmapped.
//!
//! # Growth is refusable, and the refusal is the point
//!
//! [`Arena`] holds a budget, and an [`Elastic`] that asks past it is told no
//! rather than being given memory the machine cannot spare. Under OS memory
//! pressure the budget shrinks -- but only for growth, never for what a model
//! already had to have. See [`Need`] for why that distinction is load-bearing
//! and what happened when it was not there.
//!
//! # Unmapping is a GPU operation, not a host one
//!
//! Tearing a tile out from under a running kernel is a fault. So a remap is a
//! point on the same timeline as a step -- it waits for the last committed
//! step and the next step waits for it -- which is why the operations that
//! change mappings take a [`Stepper`](super::Stepper) rather than doing it
//! behind its back. A heap is handed back only after the GPU has been
//! observed past the unmap that emptied it; until then it sits in
//! [`Arena::pending`].
//!
//! Destroying a buffer is the same rule wearing different clothes. A growth
//! is issued and not waited for, so an [`Elastic`] can reach its destructor
//! with an `updateBufferMappings` still queued against heaps it is about to
//! release. Dropping them there is a GPU page fault, not a leak -- so the
//! destructor waits for the mapping timeline first, and leaks rather than
//! frees if that wait runs out. See [`Fence`].
