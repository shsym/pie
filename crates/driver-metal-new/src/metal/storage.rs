//! The decode step's resident storage: weights, KV, GDN state, IO and the
//! scratch pool, allocated and staged.
//!
//! The C++ (`loader/heap_bind.cpp::stage_decode_storage`) allocates each
//! region and stages the load plan's weights with its own transform loops.
//! This port allocates the same regions, but the weights come from
//! `model_loader::executor::host::execute_plan` — the engine `transcode.hpp`
//! was a mirror of (see `PARITY-LOADER.md`) — so every TileMap the plan
//! carries (MXFP4 decode, affine encode, casts) has already run by the time
//! a byte reaches the device buffer.
//!
//! Weights land in ONE shared region and each tensor is a [`Handle`] slice
//! of it, keyed by runtime name: hundreds of per-tensor buffers would be
//! hundreds of residency entries, and the argument tables want stable
//! GPU addresses, not a map that reallocates.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here yet, implementation-first (the ledger
//! carries each):
//!
//! * zero-copy mapping and weight streaming (`resolve_mappable`, the
//!   stream pack) — memory optimizations; every checkpoint loads correctly
//!   through the copy path, some just resident-larger;
//! * the expert-slab staging arm (`ExpertSlabRequest`) — the slab type
//!   exists (`crate::loader::ExpertSlab`); wiring it here needs the paging
//!   fire path;
//! * elastic sizing of KV/scratch (`alloc_zeroed`'s initial-commit
//!   parameter) — regions allocate at full size for now.

/// # Why this had to come back

/// The C++ had `fits_on_this_gpu` and the port dropped it. The machinery to

/// `the_tighter_ceiling_wins_and_silence_is_not_a_refusal` has been testing
/// it the whole time — with no caller anywhere. Implemented, tested, and
/// unreachable, which is the pattern that makes a capability a caps lie.
///
/// What its absence costs is recorded in the tree already:
/// `device_checkpoint_names.rs` notes that *"the 26B gemma4 on this machine
/// is SIGKILLed by the staging test"*, and the guard existed to keep a
/// process from being left hung and unkillable instead. A refusal naming
/// both numbers is strictly better than the kernel's answer.

///

/// ceiling could be read, because refusing on silence turns a diagnostic
