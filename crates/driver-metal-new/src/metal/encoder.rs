//! Encoding a step, committing it, and waiting for it with a bound.
//!
//! A step is an allocator reset, one or more encoded command buffers, a
//! commit, and a wait on a shared event. The shape is the C++ shell's
//! `encode_one_command_buffer` and `await_event`, with the two things that
//! were comments there made into types here.
//!
//! # Three shapes, and what separates them
//!
//! [`Stepper::run`] is one command buffer. [`Stepper::run_parallel`] is N
//! buffers in ONE `commit:count:options:` under ONE event signal -- the
//! buffers race each other on purpose, so what it buys is `N - 1` submissions
//! and what it demands is that the chunks be mutually hazard-free. Metal
//! gives no ordering between command buffers in a batch and a barrier only
//! orders dispatches inside the encoder that issued it, so nothing here can
//! check that requirement; it is the caller's.
//!
//! [`Stepper::run_segments`] is the opposite trade and the reason both exist:
//! N buffers committed and waited for one at a time, with a host callback
//! between them. It is the only one of the three where the host can read what
//! the GPU just computed and change what it reads next, because the other two
//! commit everything before waiting for anything. That is right when the host
//! has nothing to add and impossible when it does -- for expert paging what
//! the host holds is which weights exist at all. It costs a submit and a
//! completion wait per segment, so splitting a step that does not need the
//! host is a straight loss.
//!
//! # The wait has a bound, and running out of it is terminal
//!
//! `waitUntilSignaledValue:` with no timeout is how the C++ shell spent
//! twenty-two minutes silent inside a bare retry loop. The bound here is
//! deliberately far past any real step -- the slowest measured on this
//! machine, a 192-token prefill through a 30B mixture, is about 200 ms -- so
//! reaching it does not mean "slow", it means the GPU is not coming back.
//!
//! What happens then is the part worth stating: nothing. A command buffer
//! that has not signalled may still be executing, so its allocator cannot be
//! reset and the heap it reads cannot be freed. There is no recovery, so
//! [`Stepper`] latches into a wedged state and refuses every later step
//! rather than papering over it with a retry.
