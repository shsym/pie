//! Buffers this context did not allocate, and the residency they still need.
//!
//! Two things live here and they answer the same question from opposite
//! sides. [`Mapped`] builds a Metal buffer over host pages -- an `mmap` of a
//! checkpoint, in practice -- so a 19 GB file is never copied into a Metal
//! allocation. [`Externals`] takes a buffer someone else allocated, an
//! authoritative channel ring being the case it exists for, and adds it to
//! this context's residency set without claiming to own it.
//!
//! # Why a no-copy buffer is not just an optimisation
//!
//! `newBufferWithLength:` over a checkpoint means the bytes exist twice: once
//! in the page cache the loader read them through and once in a Metal
//! allocation, and the second copy is dirty anonymous memory the kernel
//! cannot evict. A file-backed mapping wrapped with
//! `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy:` is demand-faulted under GPU access and its
//! pages stay CLEAN, so the kernel reclaims them under pressure and faults
//! them back when the GPU next reads. That is what weight streaming is on
//! Apple silicon, and it is why nothing here checks the working set: a
//! mapping larger than the working set is the intended case, not the error
//! case, and refusing it would defeat the entire point.
//!
//! # What the caller still owns
//!
//! Metal is handed a `deallocator:` of `nil`, so it will not unmap anything.
//! The mapping must outlive the [`Mapped`], and the buffer must be gone
//! before the pages are. Rust cannot check that -- the pages are not a Rust
//! allocation -- so [`Mapped::new`] is `unsafe` and the obligation is stated
//! there rather than in a comment beside the call.
//!
//! # Residency, and the leak it used to be
//!
//! Both of these have to be added to the residency set individually: they are
//! not inside the placement heap, so the one `addAllocation` that covers
//! every heap slot does not cover them. Both then have to be REMOVED, and
//! that is the part the C++ shell notes was leaking -- a pool that grows and
//! shrinks left every old buffer retained and resident forever. Here removal
//! is `Drop`, so forgetting it is not something the API can express.
