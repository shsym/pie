//! The placement heap, and the slots placed in it.
//!
//! One heap, Shared storage, hazard tracking off, and every buffer the driver
//! holds for the life of a model placed inside it at an offset this module
//! chose. The three decisions are worth stating because none of them is a
//! default:
//!
//! * **Placement.** An automatic heap picks offsets itself and will not tell
//!   you which; a placement heap is address space plus a promise, and the
//!   offsets are ours. That is what makes a slot's location reproducible from
//!   one run to the next, which is what makes a captured command buffer
//!   replayable.
//! * **Shared.** On UMA there is no copy to avoid, so `contents()` is a real
//!   CPU pointer into the same bytes the GPU reads. Weight staging and the
//!   per-step scalar writes both go through it.
//! * **Untracked.** Metal's automatic hazard tracking would insert barriers
//!   per resource; this driver knows its own dependency graph and issues them
//!   per dispatch. Leaving tracking on would pay for both.
//!
//! # Residency
//!
//! The heap is added to the residency set ONCE, as a whole. A placement
//! sub-buffer created later is inside a range that is already resident, so it
//! needs no registration of its own -- which is the property that makes
//! allocating mid-run cheap rather than a residency rebuild.
