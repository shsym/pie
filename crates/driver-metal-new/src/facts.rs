//! What a `pie.model/1` descriptor says about a checkpoint's shape.
//!
//! Portable, and that is the point: the descriptor is text and the facts are
//! integers, so the one reading in the driver that decides a model's geometry
//! can be tested without a GPU, a Metal device or an Apple host. The C++ this
//! replaces (`csrc/src/model_facts.{hpp,cpp}`) is compiled into the driver
//! library and therefore only testable where that library links.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! * `read_model_facts`, the `config.json` reader. Its own header calls it
//!   test-only and on its way out -- no driver code calls it any more, because
//!   the boot reads a descriptor and normalization happens once, in Rust,
//!   before the driver exists. Porting it would be porting a second answer to
//!   a question that already has one, which is the shape of the disagreement
//!   the descriptor path was introduced to end.
//! * `fill_family_geometry`. It writes into `SetupConfig`, which is the
//!   executor, and the executor is not ported yet. A port of it now would have
//!   to invent a destination type and then be rewritten when the real one
//!   arrives.
//!
//! # Reading rules
//!
//! A key that is present but of the wrong JSON type leaves the default
//! standing rather than becoming zero. That mirrors the C++ helpers
//! (`i32_of` / `u32_of` / `f32_of` all test the value's kind before
//! assigning) and it matters: a default here is a documented number that some
//! geometry was written against, and a silent zero is a shape no checkpoint
//! has.
