//! What this driver tells the loader, and the plan it gets back.
//!
//! The C++ (`loader/load_plan.hpp`) reached the Rust loader through the C
//! ABI: open a checkpoint handle, marshal a request, get a marshalled plan.
//! This port calls the same crates — `model` for the author registry,
//! `model-loader` for the compiler — in-process, so the wire structs and
//! their lifetime rules disappear; what remains is what the driver alone
//! knows and must state.
//!
//! That is three things. Which tile transforms its kernels implement
//! ([`METAL_TILE_MAP_MASK`]); its storage constants
//! ([`metal_storage_target`]); and the loading policy that makes equal
//! requests author equal contracts ([`compile_load_plan`] states every
//! field rather than defaulting any). The loader has no opinion of its own:
//! it refuses a transform outside the mask rather than emitting one the
//! executor would then have to reject.
