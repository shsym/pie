// `PIE_LOADER_ENTRY_ANCHOR` and `PIE_FORWARD_ENTRY_ANCHOR` existed because a

// callers of `pie_loader_compile_model` and `pie_forward_trace_llama_like`
// were the C++ drivers, which link after Rust, so without a reference from
// reachable Rust the entry points were simply absent at final link.
//
// Both drivers are Rust now. `model-loader` and `model` are called directly,
// through their own types, and there is nothing on the far side of an FFI
