//! Differential parity between [`KvCacheFormat`] and the C++ it replaces.
//!
//! This is the migration protocol from `.wiki/plan/model-in-rust.md` §8
//! applied to `store/kv_cache_format.{hpp,cpp}`: build the C++ as an oracle,
//! sweep both implementations over the same grid, and require the outputs to
//! be byte-identical before the C++ is allowed to go.
//!
//! # Reproducing the proof
//!
//! `kv_cache_format.cpp` depends only on `tensor.hpp` and
//! `kernels/kv_cache_view.hpp`, both header-only and both free of CUDA, so the
//! real translation unit builds with a plain host compiler:
//!
//! ```text
//! cat > oracle.cpp <<'EOF'
//! #include "store/kv_cache_format.hpp"
//! #include <cstdio>
//! // ... same three loops as `dump()` below, with printf ...
//! EOF
//!
//! g++ -std=c++20 \
//!     -Icrates/driver-cuda/csrc/src \
//!     -Icrates/kernels-cuda/csrc/src \
//!     oracle.cpp crates/driver-cuda/csrc/src/store/kv_cache_format.cpp -o oracle
//!
//! ./oracle > cpp.txt
//! cargo test -p driver-cuda --test kv_format_parity -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! That was run, and the two outputs matched exactly: 11,498 rows, 434,348
//! bytes, no differing line. [`GOLDEN_FNV1A64`] is the hash of the C++ side of
//! that run, so the proof survives the C++ being deleted -- which is the whole
//! point of taking it before rather than after.
//!
//! Both `-I` trees above are now gone, which is why the recipe is a record
//! and not an instruction: `crates/driver-cuda/csrc` at `4569b9e4b`, and
//! `crates/kernels-cuda/csrc` -- the ARCHIVE crate's -- with that crate at
//! `85c6c674b`.
