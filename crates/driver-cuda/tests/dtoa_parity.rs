//! Differential proof that [`driver_cuda::layout::dtoa`] is
//! `nlohmann::json`'s double formatter.
//!
//! # What is pinned, and why it is the C++'s hash
//!
//! The golden below is the FNV-1a 64 of the output of
//! `tests/oracle/dtoa/oracle.cpp`, which formats 200,041 doubles through
//! `nlohmann::json::dump()`. This test regenerates the identical corpus and
//! formats it through the Rust port. If the hashes match, the two agree on
//! every one of those values, byte for byte.
//!
//! The number is the **C++'s**, never the Rust's. A golden captured from the
//! implementation under test can be re-blessed by the next change to that
//! implementation, which is the one thing a parity test must not permit.
//!
//! Run `tests/oracle/dtoa/run.sh` to regenerate it.
//!
//! # Why bother at all
//!
//! Rust's own `{}` already round-trips, so this is not about correctness of
//! the value. It is about the planner profile cache being one file that two
//! implementations read-merge-rewrite. Grisu2 and shortest-correctly-rounded
//! disagree on roughly 0.07% of realistic values, so a port that used `{}`
//! would silently rewrite entries it never touched.
