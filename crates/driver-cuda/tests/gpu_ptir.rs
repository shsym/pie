//! The PTIR compile plane, against a real GPU.
//!
//! # Why this test exists and what it is allowed to claim
//!
//! `cuda-progress.md` records the rule this suite is written under: *"Non-GPU
//! green is weak evidence. Every dispatch defect found on 2026-08-10 compiled
//! cleanly and passed the full non-GPU battery."* The unit tests beside
//! [`driver_cuda::program::cache`] and [`driver_cuda::program::compile`] pin arithmetic — a cache key, a rounded
//! launch width — and arithmetic is exactly the class of thing that can be
//! right in isolation and wrong against a driver.
//!
//! So this file compiles real CUDA with the real NVRTC, loads the real cubin,
//! and asks the real driver what it thinks. What it deliberately does NOT do
//! is launch a PTIR program: the lane table, the device rings and the fire are
//! not written yet, and a test that pretended otherwise would be the thing
//! §5.D1 refuses — code whose only gate is that it compiles.
//!
//! Skipped without a device, like every other `gpu_*` binary here.
