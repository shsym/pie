/// fail for as long as a capture is open. So it is not enough to serialise
/// captures against each other: an unrelated `cudaMemsetAsync` on another test
/// thread will fail too, and it will fail intermittently depending on how the
/// harness interleaves them.

///     into a red suite would say the code is broken when the truth is that
///     this binary is not the one for this machine.

/// failing -- is a **failure**, because at that point something really is
