//! The driver must not know what a model is — measured, not asserted.
//!
//! `crates/model/tests/one_normalizer.rs` states the rule: *"what a
//! driver reads is the answer, never the question"*, and names its own
//! ceiling — *"nothing stops a future reader from opening `config.json`
//! again."* A grep is a guard that must be remembered, which is exactly
//! the failure mode it warns about. This is the grep, so that the
//! remembering is the build's job.
//!
//! # Why a ratchet rather than zero
//!
//! The 33-row `model_type` table is gone from this crate — it lives in
//! `model::catalog`, which is where the question is allowed to
//! be asked — and the fire path reads a `Deployment` with no family
//! name in it. What is left is not dispatch:
//!
//! - `layout/memory_planner.rs` sizes a KV pool per architecture,
//!   because the COST of a token genuinely differs. That is arithmetic
//!   about bytes, not a branch about behaviour.
//! - `bind/` names kernels, and a kernel's name is its own.
//! - `serve/encode.rs` serves gemma-4's towers, which is a real
//!   family-specific ABI entry and the next thing to generalise.
//!
//! Each is a separate argument, and collapsing them into one number
//! would hide which is which. So this pins the number per FILE: a file
//! may not gain family names, and a file that loses them ratchets the
//! bound down.
//!
//! # What the count reads
//!
//! Two corrections, both found in `driver-metal` and ported here so the
//! backends are held to one standard rather than to whichever names each
//! happened to notice. The count skips `#[cfg(test)]` blocks, because a
//! test naming the family it covers is an asset; five files left this
//! table outright once their only mentions were their own fixtures. And
//! it compares case- and punctuation-blind, which raised
//! `memory_planner.rs` from 25 to 30 and surfaced `fire/lora.rs`, a file
//! that had never been listed.
//!
//! **A file not in the table may have none at all.** That is the half
//! that matters — it is what stops a new dispatch site appearing
//! somewhere quiet.
