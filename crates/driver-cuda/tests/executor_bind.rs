//! The binder over a REAL lowering (retirement plan phase C, first brick).
//!
//! Not a synthetic launch list: `qwen3_0_6b`'s traced decode and prefill
//! forms — the parity-anchored deployment, the same texts the committed
//! `.inc`s are emitted from — lowered over plain rows, then EVERY launch
//! bound through `executor::bind`. What that proves, GPU-free:
//!
//! * every arena offset the lowering assigns is inside the arena it
//!   sized (`arena_bytes` and the offsets agree with each other);
//! * every weight and named value the trace states reaches the resolver
//!   (the map is the only per-family piece left, as designed);
//! * every kernel symbol the lowering emits has a STATED row in the
//!   bridge's tables — DSL or driver-internal — so a generated
//!   `pie_k_*` entry exists for the dispatch half to call. This is the
//!   claim that phase C's dispatch can be written at all.
