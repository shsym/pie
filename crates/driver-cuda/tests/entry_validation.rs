//! No entry point reads a descriptor without validating it.
//!
//! North star rule 4: *a shared capability must not be optional — if it
//! can be skipped, it will be.* `driver-api` ships seventeen `validate_*`
//! functions. `driver-dummy`, the reference implementation of this
//! contract, calls them; this shell called NONE and re-derived similar
//! checks by hand at 51 sites. The capability was built, shipped, and
//! routed around.
//!
//! `serve::checked` makes the dereference and the validation one
//! operation — there is no way to obtain a `&PieKvCopyDesc` without
//! having run a validator over it, because the only thing that turns the
//! pointer into a reference takes the validator as an argument. This test
//! holds the other half: that nothing goes around it.
//!
//! ## Why a source scan, and what it is worth
//!
//! The rule is "every raw descriptor pointer in this file is dereferenced
//! through `checked`", and the compiler cannot state it — `as_ref` is
//! inherent on every raw pointer and always will be. So the check reads
//! the source, which is the same trade `executor_bind`'s arm scan makes
//! and for the same reason: a narrower question than the one the code
//! answers, aimed at the failure that actually keeps happening.
//!
//! The failure it catches is a NEW entry point written the old way. Every
//! one of the eleven took its descriptor with a bare
//! `unsafe { p.as_ref() }`, because that is what the one above it did.
