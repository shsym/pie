//! What a paged KV cache actually allocates, layer by layer.
//!
//! Port of `driver-cuda/csrc/src/store/kv_cache.cpp`'s two `allocate`
//! overloads, its `resolve_`/`head_dim_at`/`num_kv_heads_at` accessors, and
//! its envelope tier.
//!
//! The C++ decides and allocates in the same expression: a shape is written
//! inline as an argument to `DeviceTensor::allocate`, so the only trace it
//! leaves is a device pointer. That is why this file exists as a separate
//! layer. [`KvCacheLayout::plan`] returns the whole manifest as a value --
//! every tensor the cache will own, in slot order, with its dtype and extents
//! -- and [`KvCacheLayout::allocate`] then walks it. The decision becomes
//! comparable, and the layout of a fifty-layer heterogeneous cache under a
//! quantised format can be checked against the C++ without a GPU.
//!
//! # The three things this layer gets wrong if it is careless
//!
//! * **Aliasing.** A layer whose `kv_source_layer[i] != i` allocates *nothing*
//!   and reads through to its source. The C++ still pushes an empty
//!   placeholder so that slot index equals layer index; drop the placeholder
//!   and every layer after the first alias is off by one.
//! * **Tiers.** A non-native-BF16 format allocates a dequantisation mirror per
//!   layer, and a scaled format allocates a scale pair whose trailing extent
//!   depends on `block_size`. Both are easy to size against the wrong
//!   `head_dim` in a per-layer stack.
//! * **Envelopes.** They are allocated with the pool or not at all, and only
//!   for native BF16 in NHD order. The comment in the C++ explains why at
//!   length: switching them on later leaves every already-written page at the
//!   empty seed, which scores `+inf` -- "always keep" -- forever.
