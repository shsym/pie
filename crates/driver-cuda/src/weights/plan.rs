//! What this driver tells the loader, and the plan it gets back.
//!
//! The C++ (`loader/load_plan.hpp`) reached the Rust loader through the C ABI:
//! open a checkpoint handle, marshal a request, get a marshalled plan back,
//! then run it with `load_plan_executor.hpp`. In-process there is no wire, and
//! the executor is `model_loader::executor::Execution` driven through a
//! [`DeviceArena`](super::arena::DeviceArena) — so what is left here is only
//! what the driver alone knows.
//!
//! Which is less than it was. The loading policy stated all seven
//! [`model::shared::policy::Policy`] fields here, and `driver-metal` stated the same
//! seven, differing in exactly two; the comment below the file check said the
//! other driver "carried the same block, bit for bit". Equal requests have to
//! author equal contracts, and two copies of a policy cannot promise that —
//! a field added to `Policy` gets a considered value on the copy its author
//! was reading and a `Default` on the other, and nothing fails to compile.
//! The five shared answers are [`model::boot`]'s now. What stays here is the
//! two this driver knows, named [`Binding::HF_FUSED`].

/// This device's storage capability, for one rank of a tensor-parallel group.
///
/// `tp_rank`/`tp_size` are the whole of what makes a load SHARDED. Every
/// family's contract states its splits in terms of them
/// (`Builder::local_extent`, `Builder::split`), so a rank compiles a plan that
/// reads only its own bands out of the checkpoint and allocates an arena sized
/// to them. The driver never slices a tensor itself.
///
/// The KV cache is sharded from the same two numbers, one layer down
/// (`layout::kv_geometry` divides `num_key_value_heads` by `tp_size`), so the
/// weights and the cache cannot disagree about how wide a rank is.
///
/// Everything else — the alignment, the tile budget, the transform mask — is
/// `StorageTarget::for_backend`'s. This module used to state all of it, and
/// the mask twice over: once here and once in `model_loader::plan::passes::tile`,
/// with a test comparing them. A driver is the authority on what its kernels
/// do only until the loader has to own the fallback for each one, which it
/// does; so there is one statement now, and it is the loader's.

///
/// - [`Projections::Fused`](model::shared::policy::Projections::Fused) because the
///   dense attention and MLP GEMMs take one operand — `layer.N.qkv`,
///   `layer.N.gate_up`. The driver used to build those itself, at load, by
///   reading three tensors BACK off the device and re-uploading their
///   concatenation. The plan states the same joins as `BulkExtentWrite`s into
///   the arena, so the bytes land fused the first and only time they are
///   copied.
/// - [`Naming::Hf`](model::shared::policy::Naming::Hf) because this driver binds
///   checkpoint names.
///
/// The remaining five policy fields, the author call, the compile and the
/// declared-file check are [`model::boot::compile_load_plan`]'s, shared with
/// `driver-metal`.

/// that does not exist, the contract does not compile, or a file the plan
