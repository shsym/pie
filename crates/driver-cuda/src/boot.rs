//! Every boot knob this driver reads, parsed once and answered from a
//! value.
//!
//! Named for the BOOT rather than for configuration, because the two
//! things called "config" here are unrelated: one is what a deployment
//! asked this driver to do, the other is what the weights on disk say
//! they are. The second no longer has a schema — a checkpoint's identity
//! is a [`model::catalog`] row now, matched by tensors rather than parsed
//! from a `config.json` — which makes the distinction easier to keep than
//! it was when a `model::config::schema` sat next to this file.
//!
//! # Why one struct rather than ten call sites
//!
//! The knobs used to be read where they were needed: `PIE_CUDA_RUNAHEAD`
//! in the fire path, `PIE_CUDA_KV_ENVELOPES` in the KV pool,
//! `PIE_ATTN_SCORE_WINDOW` behind a `OnceLock` in the score sink,
//! `PIE_RS_STASH_TOKENS` in the recurrent cache, `PIE_LOADER_DEVICE_TRANSFORMS`
//! in the weight arena. Each had its own parser, and they did not agree:
//! one accepted `1|true|on`, another rejected only `0`, a third
//! hand-rolled a signed integer scan over `OsStr` bytes.
//!
//! Three things follow from that, and one struct fixes all three:
//!
//! 1. **There was nowhere to ask what this driver is configured as.** A
//!    reader had to already know the names to find them.
//! 2. **A typo is silent.** `PIE_CUDA_RUNAHED=0` reads as absent, which
//!    means enabled, which is the opposite of what was asked for.
//! 3. **The parsers drift.** `PIE_LOADER_DEVICE_TRANSFORMS=false` turned
//!    the transforms ON, because that one rejected only the string `"0"`.
//!    That is not hypothetical; it is what the code did.
//!
//! # The environment is a fallback, not the source
//!
//! Every knob can come from the boot TOML the engine hands
//! `pie_cuda_create`. The environment is read only where the TOML says
//! nothing, and the order matters: the TOML is what a deployment
//! STATED, and an inherited variable should not silently overrule it.
