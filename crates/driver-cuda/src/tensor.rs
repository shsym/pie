//! A typed, shaped region of device memory, and the shape arithmetic that
//! decides how large it is.
//!
//! Port of `kernels-cuda/csrc/src/tensor.hpp`'s `DeviceTensor`. The C++ class
//! fuses two things that fail in different ways and are testable by different
//! means:
//!
//! * the **shape arithmetic** -- what `dtype` and what extents, hence how many
//!   bytes -- which is pure host code, is where the interesting mistakes live,
//!   and today can only be exercised by allocating on a GPU;
//! * the **allocation** itself, which is a `cudaMalloc` and either works or
//!   returns an error.
//!
//! They are split here into [`TensorSpec`] and [`DeviceTensor`]. The pools in
//! [`crate::store`] build a `Vec<TensorSpec>` first and allocate from it
//! second, so the layout of a KV cache -- which layers are real, which are
//! aliases, which tiers a quantised format adds -- can be compared against the
//! C++ exactly, on a machine with no CUDA device at all.
//!
//! # What the split buys
//!
//! The C++ `KvCache::allocate_per_layer` interleaves the decision and the
//! `cudaMalloc`: the shape is an argument to a call whose result is a pointer,
//! so nothing observable survives to be checked. The only way to ask "did this
//! allocate the right thing" is to allocate it. Producing the specification as
//! a value first makes that question answerable by comparing two vectors.
