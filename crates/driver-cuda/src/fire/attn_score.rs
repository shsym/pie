//! One layer's attention scores, published for the duration of that
//! layer's `OnAttn` hook — gate-score-capture.
//!
//! Ports `model/attn_score.cu`: the decode capture (one query row per
//! request), the prefill capture (SnapKV's observation window), the shared
//! score-slot carve in the fire's [`SidebandArena`], and the hook-graph
//! prepare helper that refreshes the replay-read host CSR.
//!
//! # The scratch, made explicit
//!
//! The C++ keeps the host CSRs in `thread_local` vectors for two reasons:
//! allocation reuse across the layers of a fire, and ADDRESS IDENTITY —
//! a captured hook body's upload node reads that storage at replay time,
//! so the prepare pass must refresh the same bytes at the same address.
//! Rust makes the identity a value: the caller owns a [`ScoreScratch`] and
//! passes it to every capture and prepare of a worker thread. The nested-
//! capture depth guard lives in the scratch for the same reason it guarded
//! the thread-locals: a second live capture would clobber the first one's
//! published offsets.
//!
//! # Explicit release
//!
//! As with [`super::page_mask::FirePageMask`], the arena is not owned by
//! the capture, so `Drop` cannot release the slot; `release(&mut arena)`
//! is the destructor and `Drop` only `debug_assert!`s it ran.
//!
//! # The capture pipeline, now that all four launches are routine calls
//!
//! [`ScoreOps`] is the seam every kernel this module fires goes through, and
//! what is on the far side of it is now a `fn` call:
//! `kernels_cuda_new::x::attn::attention_score_post::*` for three of them and
//! `x::attn::attention_flashinfer::attn_score_fold_heads` for the fourth,
//! each taking a [`Ctx`](kernels_cuda_new::jit::Ctx) on the fire's own stream.
//! The chain that used to be here — `unit_of` -> `cache::module` ->
//! `Args::bind` -> a hand-built `Launch` — is gone with the units: a routine
//! names its own instantiation, and its argument list is a `fn` signature the
//! Rust compiler checked rather than a `[ArgValue]` bound against a row. The
//! capture pipeline reads:
//!
//! ```text
//! decode   FA2 kernel   C++    dispatch_attention_flashinfer_decode_capture_bf16
//!          normalize    RUST   ScoreOps::normalize_decode
//!          fold_heads   RUST   ScoreOps::fold_heads
//!
//! prefill  FA2 kernel   C++    dispatch_attention_flashinfer_prefill_capture_bf16
//!          normalize    RUST   ScoreOps::normalize_prefill
//!          fold         RUST   ScoreOps::fold_prefill
//! ```
//!
//! Only the FA2 kernel itself is still C++, and it is C++ for a reason that
//! is written down rather than assumed: it is a template cross-product with
//! hundreds of instantiations and no table rows (`new-horizon.md` §53).
//! Everything downstream of it in the capture is Rust firing NVRTC'd device
//! text out of `kernels-cuda-new/csrc/src/attn/attention_score_post.cuh`,
//! whose root and three instantiations are
//! [`kernels_cuda_new::x::attn::attention_score_post`].
//!
//! **Stream order is why `publish` is the home.** The launches were the tail
//! of the capture dispatch, after `CUDA_CHECK(status)` and before it
//! returned. `publish` runs on the fire's stream and nothing between the
//! dispatch and it touches the score buffer, so issuing them here puts the
//! same four kernels on the same stream in the same order. What changed is
//! which language enqueues them.
//!
//! # What this cost, and what is owed
//!
//! The four launches carry four geometries the C++ stated literally, and the
//! constants that state them went with the launches: `NORMALIZE_BLOCK` and
//! `PREFILL_FOLD_GRID_Y` are `x::attn::attention_score_post`'s and
//! `FOLD_GRID_Y`/`FOLD_BLOCK` are `x::attn::attention_flashinfer`'s. That is
//! the point of the descent rather than a side effect: a block width whose
//! `__shared__` reduction it has to match, and a grid-stride fanout that is
//! not an extent, are facts about a kernel, and they now sit in the same file
//! as the kernel's root. None of the four is a `kernels::LaunchRule` and none
//! should become one.
//!
//! `tests/attn_score_parity.rs` hashes a recorder transcript of these ops
//! against a golden produced from `model/attn_score.cu`. **That file was
//! deleted in `4569b9e4b`**, so `tests/oracle/attn_score/run.sh` cannot run
//! and the golden cannot be regenerated. The transcript therefore keeps its
//! old shape: the parity `Recorder` implements the three new methods as
//! silent no-ops, documented at the point of omission, because the C++
//! program that golden describes never contained these launches — they were
//! in a different translation unit the oracle never compiled.
//!
//! `tests/attn_score_post_geometry.rs` used to pin the operand ORDER against
//! the four rows, and it cannot any more: it reads `unit::unit_of`, and the
//! rows it read are gone. What replaces it is the `fn` signatures themselves
//! — a swap inside the pointer run or inside the `int` run was the error that
//! test existed for, and the two runs are now distinct Rust types.

// stderr is the C++'s own refusal channel for these messages; routing them
// anywhere else would change what the operator sees.
