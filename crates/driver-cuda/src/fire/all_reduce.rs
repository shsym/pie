//! `comm/custom_all_reduce.cu`'s HOST PROGRAM, in Rust — 664 lines with
//! **zero** `__global__` and **zero** `<<<>>>`, which is what made it a host
//! program that happened to carry a `.cu` extension.
//!
//! The file was named for linkage, not for content. Its whole body is peer
//! access, an IPC handle exchange, two slabs of workspace with a geometry
//! computed on the host, two predicates, and a template dispatch. Exactly
//! **two lines** of it reached device text — `impl_->allreduce<__nv_bfloat16>`
//! at `custom_all_reduce.cu:614-620` and `allreduce_fusion_kernel_launcher`
//! at `:157-162` — and both live in headers this repository does not carry.
//!
//! # The four terms
//!
//! **What it fires.** Nothing, today, and that is a statement about the
//! headers rather than about this module. The two launch points name
//! `flashinfer/comm/vllm_custom_all_reduce.cuh` and
//! `flashinfer/comm/trtllm_allreduce_fusion.cuh`, which are CPM-*fetched*
//! at configure time and are **not** vendored:
//! `crates/kernels-cuda-new/csrc/src/attn/flashinfer/` holds `attention/` and
//! has no `comm/` directory at all, so NVRTC has nothing to compile. Both
//! points therefore answer [`Decline::NoDeviceText`], and each answer carries
//! the resolved [`Instantiation`] and the exact header that would supply it —
//! the refusal IS the specification for the vendoring step.
//!
//! **What sits between.** Four device allocations whose sizes are host
//! arithmetic and appear in no row's operand list: the `Signal` + staging
//! slab ([`SIGNAL_BYTES`] + `max_bytes`), the `RankData` slab (8 MiB of
//! 64-byte slots), the three fusion buffers (`buffer`, `flag`, `lamport`,
//! each 2 MiB-aligned), and the `3 * world_size + 1` pointer workspace that
//! is copied to the device once at construction. Every one of those is
//! computed by [`CustomAllReduce::new`] from the constructor block at
//! `custom_all_reduce.cu:222-401`.
//!
//! **What it decides on the host.** Whether peer access exists in both
//! directions between every pair in the group; whether the group is fully
//! connected; whether a message is worth the NVLink kernel at all
//! ([`CustomAllReduce::can_handle`], a four-term test ending in a world-size
//! crossover table); whether the fused landing is available
//! ([`CustomAllReduce::can_fuse_residual_rmsnorm`]); and which of upstream's
//! 240 compile-time instantiations a call selects ([`resolve`]).
//!
//! **What vocabulary is missing.** Only the device text. There is no
//! `LaunchRule` here and no `Launch`: this module never builds a grid,
//! because the kernels it would fire are launched by upstream's own host
//! launcher templates, which take an `AllReduceFusionParams` and compute
//! their own geometry. [`FusionParams`] mirrors that struct field for field
//! so the thing a vendored path needs is written down rather than inferred.
//!
//! # The 240-kernel cross product, and what 111s means under a JIT
//!
//! `kernels.def`'s `PIE_AR_FUSION_PATTERN` block made the argument, and the
//! measurement in it must not be consumed by this port, so it is restated
//! here with its arithmetic intact. flashinfer's `allreduce_fusion_op()`
//! turns four runtime values into one compile-time cross product:
//!
//! ```text
//!   nranks {2,4,8,16}  x  pattern {10}  x  fp32_acc {2}
//!       x  (oneshot x trigger_completion_at_end {2}, or twoshot {1})
//!     = 4 x 10 x 2 x 3
//!     = 240 kernels
//! ```
//!
//! — **96% of every kernel in `custom_all_reduce.cu`, and the reason that
//! translation unit cost 111s (40s cicc + 44s ptxas)**. pie reaches exactly
//! one pattern, `kARResidualRMSNorm`; the other nine are FP8/FP4 quant
//! epilogues no pie call site can select.
//!
//! Three of those four axes are template parameters of
//! `allreduce_fusion_kernel_launcher<Pattern, T, NRanks, Fp32Acc>` and the
//! fourth is not: `use_oneshot` and `trigger_completion_at_end` are RUNTIME
//! fields of `AllReduceFusionParams` that the launcher itself branches on to
//! pick among three `__global__`s. So the 240 is `80 host instantiations x 3
//! device leaves`, and [`Leaf`] is that third factor named. Getting this
//! decomposition wrong is how a pruning argument turns into a wrong count.
//!
//! **The measurement was about an AHEAD-OF-TIME translation unit, and under
//! a JIT it says something different.** Written out:
//!
//! ```text
//!   upstream, unpruned          4 x 10 x 2 x 3  = 240 kernels   ~111 s
//!   pie's AOT build, pruned     4 x  1 x 2 x 3  =  24 kernels   ~11 s
//!   under NVRTC, on demand              reached =   1 kernel    ~0.46 s, once
//! ```
//!
//! 111s / 240 is **~0.46s per instantiation**, and that figure is the whole
//! translation. Ahead of time it was a cost paid on the build's critical
//! path on every build, whether or not a single one of the 240 ever ran; the
//! `PIE_AR_FUSION_PATTERN` list bought back 216 of them, or ~99s. Under a
//! JIT that compiles on demand the cross product stops being a *build* cost
//! at all and becomes a **cache-key space**: a point nobody reaches is never
//! compiled, so there is nothing left for a list to prune, and the remaining
//! ~11s of pie's own pruned build goes with it. What survives is ~0.46s of
//! FIRST-CALL latency for the one point pie reaches, paid once per process
//! and off everyone else's critical path.
//!
//! So the list's job changes rather than ends. It no longer states which
//! points were BUILT; it states which points are **reachable**, and that is
//! checkable before a fire instead of during one. [`INSTANTIATED`] is that
//! list, in Rust, and [`resolve`] is the check.
//!
//! # The runtime throw became a refusal
//!
//! `kernels.def` said it plainly: *"a missing entry surfaces as a runtime
//! throw, not a link error"*. Both throws are here, and neither is spelled
//! like a failure of the launch:
//!
//! ```text
//!   custom_all_reduce.cu:171-176  "pattern N is not instantiated"
//!                                   -> Decline::PatternNotInstantiated
//!   custom_all_reduce.cu:206-209  "does not support TP world size N"
//!                                   -> Decline::WorldSizeUnsupported
//! ```
//!
//! [`fire::gemv`] is the established shape and this module follows it:
//! [`AllReduce`] is `#[must_use]`, *"it declined"* cannot be spelled like
//! *"it ran"*, and a decline enqueues **nothing** — the caller's `output` is
//! exactly as it found it, and `dist::all_reduce_bf16` (NCCL) is the other
//! arm. A refusal is never a fallback: a null `car` is
//! [`Decline::NoInstance`], matching `custom_all_reduce.hpp:170-174` and
//! `:193-197`, which threw rather than quietly reducing nothing.
//!
//! [`fire::gemv`]: crate::fire::gemv
//!
//! # What is NOT here, and why the lifecycle is
//!
//! `.wiki/driver/new-horizon.md` §43.4 records that the reachability audit
//! reports the `CustomAllReduce` lifecycle dead **and is wrong**. It is kept
//! whole. The half of `vllm::CustomAllreduce` this module absorbs —
//! `open_ipc_handle`, `get_graph_buffer_ipc_meta`, `check_rank_data_capacity`,
//! `register_buffer(void**)` and `register_graph_buffers` — is pure host code
//! in upstream too; only `allreduce<T>()` launches. So the Rust owns the
//! entire lifecycle natively and declines at exactly the two points where
//! device text is required, which is a smaller surface than the C++ had.
//!
//! One thing got *better* in the crossing rather than merely equal.
//! `custom_all_reduce.cu:340-342` initialised the Lamport buffer by calling
//! `flashinfer::trtllm_allreduce::lamportInitialize<__nv_bfloat16>`, which
//! launches a kernel to write negative-zero into every slot. Negative zero
//! in bf16 is `0x8000`, a 16-bit pattern and not a byte pattern, so
//! `cudaMemset` cannot express it — but `cuMemsetD16_v2` can, exactly, and
//! it is a driver-API call with no device text behind it. See
//! [`CustomAllReduce::new`]. That is one launch point removed rather than
//! deferred.
//!
//! # Reachability today
//!
//! `serve/load.rs:120-147` refuses `tp_size > 1` outright — *"there is no
//! NCCL in this tree and no `CustomAllReduce` handle to pass"* — so nothing
//! in this module runs in any configuration this driver currently accepts.
//! It is written whole anyway, because the alternative to writing it is
//! leaving 664 lines of C++ in an archive that is being deleted, and because
//! the thing that is missing (a vendored `comm/`) is named precisely enough
//! here that closing it is a vendoring step and not a re-derivation.

// `initialise` prints ONE line to stderr at construction, which the archive
// did at `custom_all_reduce.cu:398-404` and which is the only trace a
// deployment gets that the P2P plane came up at all. `serve/mod.rs` and
// `fire/attn_score.rs` carry the same allow for the same reason.
