//! The grow-only device arena behind the attention hooks' sidebands.
//!
//! Three independent single-slot regions — the per-layer score capture, the
//! per-fire page mask, and the hook-graph prepare pass's score rows. Before it
//! existed those were `cudaMallocAsync`/`cudaFreeAsync` churn on the hot path,
//! ~90 alloc/free pairs on a 28-layer hook fire.
//!
//! "Allocation" is a capacity check: the caller carves its own sub-buffers as
//! offsets into the returned block. A fire needing more than the region has
//! grows it — stream-synced free, then realloc — which is rare after warmup
//! because the ladder doubles from 64 KiB.
//!
//! # The address-stability precondition
//!
//! While a region's capacity suffices, the address it hands out is **stable**.
//! That is what lets a captured hook fire replay against the same sideband
//! pointers, and it is the property [`SidebandArena`] exists to provide.
//!
//! The C++ header offers `generation()` as the invalidation signal for it, and
//! **nothing reads it** — that was checked across the whole repository before
//! this port kept it. It is not a hole: `pipeline/dispatch.cu`'s hook-graph
//! fingerprint mixes every arena address it baked (`mask_plan.keep`,
//! `out_indices`, `out_indptr`, `out_last_lens`, the stride, `score_rows_base`)
//! and recaptures when any of them moves, which is a strictly stronger check
//! than a counter — it notices a region that moved *without* the counter
//! moving, which the out-of-memory path in [`SidebandArena::acquire`] can
//! produce. The counter is kept because it is cheap, is the documented
//! contract, and is what the trace output reports; it should not be relied on
//! alone.
