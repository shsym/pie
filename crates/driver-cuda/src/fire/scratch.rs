//! The fire's pooled buffers — one of the two names the cross-backend
//! dictionary settles.
//!
//! CUDA called this `serve::state::FireArrays` and justified it as
//! *"pooled so a capture can outlive the fire"*; Metal called it
//! `metal::Scratch` and justified it as *"so a fire's addresses are the
//! same as the last fire's"*. Those are one design named twice, and
//! `Scratch` is the name both crates now use.

/// The per-fire device arrays, POOLED across fires.
///
/// They used to be allocated and dropped every launch — `step_impl`'s own
/// comment said "KV pools (persistent), fire arrays (per launch)" — and
/// that is the one thing standing between the supergraph and the live
/// path. A captured exec bakes the addresses it recorded, so an arena
/// freed at the end of its fire can never be replayed into.
///
/// So they are kept and reused, and grown when a fire needs more than the
/// last one did. Growth MOVES a base address, which invalidates every
/// capture that recorded it — hence [`Self::epoch`], which is the
/// `PlanEpoch` `model::supergraph::Recordings` keys its execs on. A
/// bump means stale, and stale means recapture rather than a wrong
/// answer.
