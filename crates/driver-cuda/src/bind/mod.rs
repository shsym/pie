//! The executor's first half: binding a flat launch's operands
//! (retirement plan phase C).
//!
//! `model_compiler::lower` turns a traced fire into rectangles whose
//! operands are [`Arg`]s — an arena offset, a backend-named value, or a
//! weight name. The C++ declared executor binds those against `ws.*`
//! fields per family; THIS binder is the family-independent replacement
//! the flat list was designed for: three resolution rules, stated once.
//!
//! What binding is NOT: dispatch. A bound launch still has to reach its
//! `pie_k_*` entry with the operands in the row's own order, and that
//! per-kernel arm is the executor's other half — it grows kernel by
//! kernel beside the bridge. Splitting the two means the binder is pure
//! host logic, provable against a real lowered trace with no GPU and no
//! bridge in the build.

/// The kernel-facing records and the generated `extern "C"` bridge —
/// what a bound launch is bound TO.

/// It was ungated, and `service.rs:44-49` argues the case at length:
/// `cudarc` `dlopen`s cuBLAS at first use, there is **no `#[link]`, no
/// `build.rs` flag and no header**, so `cargo check` with no CUDA toolkit on
/// PATH still passes — and `build.rs`'s `cargo:rustc-link-lib=cublas` is for
/// the archive's callers, not for this file.
///
/// **Every word of that is true, and it is about LINKING.** The module also
/// names [`DispatchCtx`] twenty-eight times, and `DispatchCtx` had exactly
/// one definition, `#[cfg(feature = "bridge")]`, with no `not(bridge)` arm
/// anywhere in the tree. So without the feature the module compiled and its
/// type did not exist.
///
/// **It checked the `-l` and not the `use`.** `cargo test -p driver-cuda
/// --features cuda-12` could not compile, and nothing went red for it,
/// because `[[test]] gemm_service_parity` requires `bridge` while its subject
/// module did not — so no green job ever compiled this module without the
/// type it needs.
///
/// `f38d199c2` closed that by gating the CONSUMER, and BRIDGE_RETIREMENT.md
/// §2.2 convicts the fix: **`DispatchCtx` is not the archive's.** Thirty-five
/// fields — two handle pointers, scalars, three `Vec`s, a `BTreeMap`, device
/// pointers — and not one type that `launch_bindings.rs` declares. The two
/// halves did have to agree; the gated one was the one lying. So the same
/// break closes the other way, and this module is `_cuda` with its type.
///
/// The earlier claim here — *"this module is the consumer that makes the

/// * [`Self::as_ptr`] is `const` and is called from [`AttnCtx`], which builds

/// * A `*mut` field keeps `DecodePlan` `!Send` and `!Sync` exactly as it was.
///   The plan caches live behind the serve loop's locks today; making them
///   auto-`Send` here would silently widen what is allowed to hold one.
///
/// The pointer is `Box::into_raw`'d at construction and `Box::from_raw`'d in
/// `drop`, so the ownership is total and there is no path that leaks it.

// ── THE ROW WORLD'S INTERPRETER STOOD HERE, AND IS DELETED ──────────────
//
// Three items, 624 lines: `dispatch_generated`, the `Arms` enum that chose
// which generated `match` it ran, and `dispatch_jit_probe`.
//
// `dispatch_generated` was the AOT half of the dispatcher. It took a
// `BoundLaunch` and ran a `match` on `bound.kernel` that `build.rs` emitted
// from the kernel tables — one arm per row that stated where each of its
// operands came from, each arm resolving that row's operands out of the
// `DispatchCtx`/`AttnCtx`/`GdnCtx` and calling the row's `pie_k_*` entry.
// The scaffolding around the `include!` (`width_of`, the operand readers,
// the nested `attn_plan`) was promoted out of the generated file so a
// generated arm read as ordinary Rust.
//
// # It is deleted because `ROW_TABLES` is empty, NOT because the archive went
//
// This is the distinction BRIDGE_RETIREMENT.md's §2 table did not have a
// column for. `emit_rust_dispatch` emits an arm per STATED row;
// `abi::stated()` drops a row with no operands; `table::ROW_TABLES` is `&[]`
// as of `5a789298b`, and every row `table::KERNELS` still holds is a
// `Contract::sig`, which states no operands deliberately — that is the third
// of the three mechanisms by which a row loses its ahead-of-time entry. So
// the generated `match` has no arms, and this function could only return
// `false`. **A dispatcher with no arms is not a smaller dispatcher.**
//
// `Arms` was a two-variant enum, `Whole` and `JitProbe`, selecting between
// `rust_dispatch.rs` and `rust_dispatch_probe.rs` at the one `include!`
// site. Both files are generated from the same empty tables.
//
// `dispatch_jit_probe` was the AOT-vs-JIT parity harness's half of the seam:
// the same rows with every unit-hosted one forced onto its JIT arm, so a row
// could be fired both ways and compared BEFORE routing deleted its shim
// entry. It had no caller — `tests/jit_parity.rs` is a two-line
// PLACEHOLDER-REFACTOR-SCAFFOLD and there is no `[[test]]` stanza for it —
// and the window it existed for is closed: routing is done, every row is
// crossed, and there is no unrouted row left to compare against. Its
// `jit-parity` feature goes with it.
//
// # The homonym test, run on all three names first
//
// §6's own rule, earned by `arm_body`: a name that reads row-world may be a
// homonym, and a classifier seeded with the claim it is checking returns the
// claim. `Arms` is a closed set of six identifier uses, all in this file,
// all at the `include!` or its two callers. `dispatch_generated` is three
// sites — the definition and the two callers deleted here.
// `dispatch_jit_probe` is three, none of them a call. None of the three has
// a second meaning anywhere in the workspace. Contrast `arm_body`,
// `OpenCond` and `cond_path`, which the ledger filed in this same class and
// which interpret `model_compiler::lower::CondRegion` and
// `device::Cond` — arms of a CUDA-GRAPH CONDITIONAL. They are live, they are
// `_cuda`, and `run_captured` is why.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FA2 DISPATCH ARMS — six driver ops, resolved by hand.
//
// # Why these are hand-written and not generated
//
// Everything above this line is a SERVICE entry point: a function the
// generated shim calls with every operand already resolved. The resolution
// itself lives in `abi::emit_rust_dispatch`'s output — `rust_dispatch.rs`,
// a `match` arm per row, built from the row's `Source`s. For these six that
// arm IS the host program: it picks the plan, tests the fire's pointers,
// widens the `Or`s and calls the shim, which calls back into the function
// above.
//
// `emit_rust_dispatch` dies with `bridge` (north star §5 step 6 half B), and
// `bridge` goes when `ROW_TABLES` empties — which is what `table/attn.rs`'s
// remaining rows are. So these six resolutions have to be written by hand
// WHATEVER order the migration takes them in; writing them at the crossing
// is paying step 6's cost while the information is in front of the reader
// rather than three weeks later when it is not.
//
// # Why a driver op and not a bind
//
// `x/mod.rs`'s discriminator, answered in one line: **`DecodePlanCache` and
// `PrefillPlanCache`.** Boxed, mutable, owned by `bind::DecodePlan` /
// `bind::PrefillPlan`, raised by `Prepare::DecodePlan` / `Prepare::PrefillPlan`
// once per fire and read by every layer's dispatch. A `Cx` that could hand
// one over is §3.3's forbidden surface exactly — a cache a bind body could
// re-plan, mid-fire, from inside what is supposed to be a query.
//
// So the six take `x::SIGS`' third registration shape: a `contract!` in
// `x::attn` with **no `Entry` at all**, not even a `none:` arm — which would
// mint `Route::Unbound` and refuse the model at load — plus an entry in
// `execution::SERVICE` as `Service::DriverOp`, which is what `x::route` reads
// to answer `Route::Driver`.
//
// # What each arm reproduces
//
// Every guard the generated branch carried becomes a refusal here, and the
// order is the generated one because it is load-bearing: `attn.is_some()`
// before anything reaching `AttnCtx`, the plan's null test after it. What was
// a guard that made the branch NOT MATCH — falling through to whatever else
// serves the statement — is a refusal here, because nothing else serves these
// symbols: the row named one launcher and the statement named the row.
//
// The one guard with no counterpart is `spec.aux.is_empty() &&
// spec.per_head_dim.is_none()`. Those are join facts no `Source` can name
// (`bind/mod.rs`'s note above the generated `match`), and a statement that
// carries one is asking for a reading this launcher does not have. Refused
// with the fact named rather than ignored.
//
// **Every refusal is resolved before the first launch**, which is free here:
// each arm is one call.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// `Source::AttnPlan`'s rule, on the side of the seam that survives `bridge`.
///
/// # Why it moved here
///
/// It was a nested `fn` inside `bind::dispatch_generated`, reachable only
/// from the generated `match` in the same body — so a hand arm could not call
/// it and would have had to copy it. **It is a DECISION and not a read**:
/// two-kind families keep a second decode plan for their full-attention
/// layers because the two kinds disagree on head dim (gemma-4: 512 vs 256),
/// and the fact it turns on — `window_left_by_layer[l] == -1` — is the
/// driver's and no row can see it. A copied decision is the shape this port
/// has already found twice in `attn` alone, so the rule moves to the surviving
/// side and `dispatch_generated`'s nested `attn_plan` forwards to it.
///

    // ── THE DRIVER-OP TABLE ──────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // What is left of the hand-written match, and it is NOT a leftover.
    // §5 step 4 says "delete the hand match (its one live arm,
    // `pie_lora_qkv_correction`, becomes a normal `bind: None`-plus-driver-fn
    // entry or a bind that reaches `LoraFireState::apply`)". Neither shape
    // is right, and the reason is mechanical:
    //
    // * `bind: None` is what `Entry` uses to mean "this symbol is REFUSED,
    //   here is the sentence". This symbol is not refused — it runs, every
    //   fire that stages an adapter. Spelling "it runs through something
    //   else" as "it does not run" is the one thing `Fired` exists to
    //   prevent, one level up.
    // * A bind receives a `Cx`, which is query-only by §3.3 — no device
    //   API, no allocator, no stream mutation — and this op needs
    //   `ctx.cublas`. A cuBLAS handle is a device API with a settable
    //   stream, a math mode and a workspace, so a `Cx` that could hand one
    //   over is a `Cx` a bind body could misbehave on. That is precisely
    //   the surface §3.3 says must not exist, and it is not worth spending
    //   to delete a `match` with one arm.
    //
    // So the third shape: `execution::Service::DriverOp` — already data,
    // already read by the migration census — becomes `Route::Driver`, and
    // this match is the driver-op table it names. It holds no device text,
    // and it does NOT retire with the step-5 sweep. Step 6 deletes the
    // GENERATED match beside it; this one stays and gets a better name.
    //
    // ── THE COUNT, RE-DERIVED ────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // This paragraph used to read *"It has TWO members here and two more in
    // the verify path."* **Measured today: ELEVEN arms** — the two
    // `gemm::mla_absorb_*`, the FlashInfer six, `moe::build_moe_ptrs_\
    // aligned_bf16` and `moe::moe_grouped_gemm_bf16`. Nine arrived after the
    // sentence was written and none of them re-derived it. A literal that
    // names a length, written once and re-derived by nothing, is the class
    // this session has now catalogued sixteen times; the count is left here
    // because a reader deciding what step 6 deletes needs a right one.
    //
    // ── AND WHAT THE COUNT DOES NOT COVER ────────────────────────────────
    //
    // `execution::SERVED` names FOUR `gemm::act_x_wt_*` symbols
    // `Service::DriverOp` — `act_x_wt_bf16`, `_bf16_out_fp32`, `_bias_bf16`,
    // `grouped_act_x_wt_bf16` — and **this match has an arm for none of
    // them**, nor does anything in `driver-cuda/src` call their
    // `bind::service` bodies.
    //
    // That is not a defect this comment is hiding: `x/gemm.rs:1100` records
    // it, because the lowering emits the PORTABLE spelling `gemm::act_x_w`
    // (`GEMM_XWT`'s `lowered_as`) and that spelling resolves to
    // `Route::Unknown` today — *"the state of the floor as this family was
    // ported, and it is in the report."* Three more `gemm::` contracts
    // (`act_x_wt_channel_scaled`, `act_x_wt_grouped_scaled`,
    // `act_x_wt_mxfp4_marlin`) are in neither `SERVED` nor `table::`, so
    // `route` answers `Route::Unknown` and the arm below prints *"no
    // contract and no row declares it"* — **which is false; a contract does
    // declare all three.** Zero goldens name any of them, so nothing can
    // observe the difference, which is why it has stayed.
    //
    // The `moe` member widens the shape rather than repeating it:
    // `moe::build_moe_ptrs_aligned_bf16` IS a `__global__`, so the "a `Cx`
    // cannot hand over a device API" argument above does not apply to it at
    // all. What it cannot hand over is a LIFETIME — see the arm.
