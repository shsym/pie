//! The executor's first half: binding a flat launch's operands
//! (retirement plan phase C).
//!
//! `model_compiler::lower` turns a traced fire into rectangles whose
//! operands are [`Arg`]s — an arena offset, a backend-named value, or a
//! weight name. The C++ declared executor binds those against `ws.*`
//! fields per family; THIS binder is the family-independent replacement
//! the flat list was designed for: three resolution rules, stated once.
//!
//! What binding is NOT: dispatch. A bound launch still has to reach its
//! `pie_k_*` entry with the operands in the row's own order, and that
//! per-kernel arm is the executor's other half — it grows kernel by
//! kernel beside the bridge. Splitting the two means the binder is pure
//! host logic, provable against a real lowered trace with no GPU and no
//! bridge in the build.

/// The kernel-facing records and the generated `extern "C"` bridge —
/// what a bound launch is bound TO.

    // carries out of band. `beta_one` is not — it changes which ARG is
    // the destination, which arity guards already catch.

    // stating one, and a blanket refusal ahead of the match made every

    // guard is the fall-through finding one. Nothing blanket is left
