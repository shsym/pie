//! The driver's answer to every fact a bind arm can ask for.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/northstar.md` §3.3 asks for a query-only context a bind
//! body reads its facts out of, and says the thing plainly: *"this is a
//! promotion, not an invention"*. The API already existed — it was
//! [`dispatch_generated`](super::dispatch_generated)'s scaffolding
//! (`width_of`, `rotary_width`, `attn_plan`, `kv_view`, `is_set`) reading
//! [`DispatchCtx`], [`AttnCtx`] and [`GdnCtx`], and it was reachable only
//! from inside a generated file. This module is the same reads, named, with
//! a public caller.
//!
//! # Why the trait lives in `kernels-cuda-new` and the impl lives here
//!
//! A bind body lives in `kernels-cuda-new/src/x/`, holding the `.cuh` it
//! fires by `include_str!` (northstar §5.1 ①). The facts are the fire's,
//! which is here.
//! `driver-cuda` depends on `kernels-cuda-new` and not the other way round,
//! so the vocabulary is declared there as a trait and answered here — the
//! only direction that is not a cycle. `Cx` holds `&dyn Facts`, so a bind
//! never names a driver type and the driver never names a bind.
//!
//! # Why every method is a read
//!
//! `Fire<'_>` borrows everything it answers from, shared. There is no
//! device API on it, no allocator, no stream — the stream is passed to
//! `Entry::call` beside the `Cx` and not through it — and no `&mut`
//! anywhere. That is §3.3's safety argument stated as a type: a bind body
//! has no surface to misbehave on, so the unsafe block it eventually writes
//! is one launch and nothing else.
//!
//! # The one thing that is NOT a promotion
//!
//! `is_set` is gone. The scaffolding's `IsSet` trait answered "did the fire
//! state this?" for five different types by comparing against each type's
//! own idea of empty (`0`, `0.0`, null, `false`), and a generated guard
//! called it. Every method here answers `Option` instead, so the same
//! question is the language's and a `None` becomes a
//! [`Refusal::Unstated`](kernels_cuda_new::x::Refusal) that names the fact.
//! The zero-is-absence conventions did not go anywhere — they are written
//! into the bodies below, each beside the field it decides.
