//! Tier A: loading the device entry points, and firing them.
//!
//! `cuLaunchKernel` takes a `void**` — an array of pointers to each
//! argument's *storage* — and checks nothing. Not arity, not type, not
//! constness. `program::run` says so about the PTIR lane and its answer was
//! to keep the marshalling in one place; this is that answer generalised to
//! a table, which is the only reason it can be trusted for six kernels and
//! then for two hundred.
//!
//! # What checks what, once the shim is gone
//!
//! Three things, and it is worth being precise because "Rust launches it"
//! reads like "nothing is checked":
//!
//! 1. **The entry against the row**, at build time, by
//!    `abi::emit_device_typecheck` — a function-pointer initialisation that
//!    admits no conversions. Arity, order, constness, width.
//! 2. **The values against the row**, here, by [`Args::bind`]: an operand
//!    the row calls `I32` may not be handed a pointer, and a list of the
//!    wrong length is refused before the driver sees it. This is a check the
//!    shim path never had — there, a caller with the right TYPES in the wrong
//!    ORDER compiled fine.
//! 3. **The entry exists**, at load time, because [`KernelModule::load`]
//!    resolves every row's symbol up front rather than on first use. A
//!    missing kernel is a startup failure, not a failure on the first fire
//!    that happens to need it.
//!
//! What is genuinely lost is that (2) is a runtime check where the shim's was
//! a compile-time one. It is bought back by generation: the caller does not
//! write the list, the row does.
