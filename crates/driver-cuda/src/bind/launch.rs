//! Tier A: how a rectangle becomes a CUDA launch.
//!
//! The Metal driver has had this file for as long as it has had a generic
//! executor -- `driver-metal/src/lowering/launch.rs`, which turns a
//! [`kernels::LaunchRule`] into a thread grid. CUDA has not, because on CUDA
//! the grid was computed in C++, inside the launcher, one `(H + BLOCK - 1) /
//! BLOCK` per kernel. The two backends were not disagreeing about
//! arithmetic; only one of them had written the arithmetic down anywhere a
//! table could point at.
//!
//! So the rule vocabulary is the shared crate's and the arithmetic is this
//! backend's, which is the split [`kernels::LaunchRule`]'s own doc describes:
//! *"This is data. The arithmetic each variant names stays in the driver,
//! beside the doc comment that explains it."*
//!
//! # One axis Metal does not have
//!
//! [`Launch`] carries `smem`, and Metal's does not. Dynamic shared memory is
//! a launch parameter on CUDA and a threadgroup-memory binding on Metal, so
//! the rule has to produce it here or the reduction kernels cannot run. It is
//! the only structural difference the port found, and it is why [`Launch`] is
//! this crate's type rather than one lifted from `kernels`.
//!
//! # What is ported
//!
//! The four rules `kernels_cuda::norm_device::ENTRIES` states. Every other
//! variant answers [`Ungeometric::Unported`] rather than a guess: a rule this
//! backend has not written the arithmetic for is not a rule with a default,
//! and the whole reason the table can be trusted is that a driver refuses
//! what it cannot state.
