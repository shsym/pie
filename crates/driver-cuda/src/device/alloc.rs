//! Device allocation, and the capture discipline that makes it safe.
//!
//! # The problem this module exists to solve
//!
//! CUDA forbids synchronous allocation and free while a stream capture is
//! open. Break the rule and the capture is invalidated -- but the diagnostic
//! does not arrive at the offending call. It arrives later, on some unrelated
//! operation, as a context-wide error. cudarc has this bug today (#590): its
//! `Drop for CudaSlice` frees without consulting the capture state, so a
//! buffer that goes out of scope inside a captured region poisons everything
//! after it.
//!
//! The C++ shell obeys the rule by convention -- a comment, and reviewers who
//! remember. That is exactly the class of invariant a rewrite should be
//! cashing in, so this module encodes it twice, once for each half of the
//! problem:
//!
//! * **Allocation** is prevented at compile time. [`Allocator::alloc`] takes
//!   `&self`, [`Allocator::begin_capture`] takes `&mut self`, and the returned
//!   [`CaptureScope`] holds that exclusive borrow for its whole life. An
//!   `alloc` inside a capture does not fail at runtime; it does not build.
//!   [`Allocator`] is deliberately **not** `Clone`, because a clone would be a
//!   second handle the borrow does not cover.
//!
//! * **Freeing** cannot be prevented that way, because `Drop` is implicit and
//!   runs wherever a value happens to die. So it is made harmless instead:
//!   [`DeviceBuffer`]'s drop consults [`DeferState`] and, if a capture is
//!   open, hands the pointer to a queue that is drained when the capture
//!   closes. The pointer is still freed, just not at a moment CUDA forbids.
//!
//! # A note on testing
//!
//! [`DeferState`] is a pure state machine: it decides, and its caller acts.
//! That split is what lets the interesting half of this module be tested on a
//! machine with no CUDA -- the tests at the bottom drive real capture/free
//! interleavings, including the cross-thread one that makes the naive
//! "check an atomic, then free" version racy.
