//! Device selection.
//!
//! The C++ shell has no context type: it calls `cudaSetDevice` at the handful
//! of places that need one and relies on the primary context the runtime
//! creates lazily. This module is that, made explicit -- not a new abstraction,
//! just a name for the thing every other call in this crate already assumes.
//!
//! # Why binding is not enough
//!
//! `cudaSetDevice` only records a thread-local ordinal. It does not create the
//! primary context, and the driver API calls this crate makes for virtual
//! memory ([`crate::device::PhysicalPool`], [`crate::device::Arena`]) fail with
//! `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT` when none is current. So [`Device::bind`]
//! forces the context into existence before returning, and the driver-API
//! layers above it can stop caring how the runtime API's laziness works.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! The binding is thread-local, which is a property of the CUDA runtime and
//! not something this type hides. A [`Device`] is a token saying "this thread
//! is bound"; sending one to another thread would be a lie, so it is neither
//! [`Send`] nor [`Sync`].
