//! CUDA graphs, including the conditional nodes `batch/supergraph.cu` builds.
//!
//! # The conditional-node question, settled
//!
//! Conditional graph nodes (CUDA 12.3+) are how the shell puts an `if` inside
//! a captured graph, and they are the most exotic thing it asks of CUDA. They
//! have no wrapper in cudarc at any level -- no safe type, no `result` helper,
//! no example, no test. What they do have is complete `sys` bindings, which is
//! all that was ever needed:
//!
//! | symbol | `cudarc::runtime::sys` |
//! |---|---|
//! | `cudaGraphConditionalHandle` | type alias, `c_ulonglong` |
//! | `cudaGraphConditionalHandleCreate` | gated `cuda-12030`+ |
//! | `cudaGraphNodeTypeConditional` | `cudaGraphNodeType` discriminant 13 |
//! | `cudaGraphCondTypeIf` | `cudaGraphConditionalNodeType` discriminant 0 |
//! | `cudaConditionalNodeParams` | `{ handle, type_, size, phGraph_out }` |
//! | `cudaGraphNodeParams.conditional` | union arm |
//!
//! [`Graph::add_conditional_if`] is that sequence, once, behind a signature
//! that cannot get the union arm wrong.
//!
//! # What is device code here, and why that is not nvcc's
//!
//! `cudaGraphSetConditional` -- the call that sets the predicate -- is absent
//! from the bindings, and correctly so: it is a `__device__` function. It is
//! called from inside `supergraph_set_cond`, a `__global__` that runs on the
//! GPU and flips the branch for the next iteration.
//!
//! That kernel used to be `csrc/supergraph.cu`, compiled by nvcc into its own
//! archive, under a header that called it *"the one device function the
//! supergraph cannot express in Rust"* and a `build.rs` comment that said
//! *"this needs nvcc"*. **Both were measured and are false.** `__device__` is
//! a fact about where the call RUNS, not about which frontend may emit it:
//! NVRTC compiles this kernel, emits `.extern .func cudaGraphSetConditional`
//! plus a `call.uni`, and the driver resolves the symbol at
//! `cuModuleLoadData` -- which it must, because the symbol is declared
//! `extern __device__ __cudart_builtin__` with no definition in any toolkit
//! header and no definition in `libcudadevrt.a`. nvcc's PTX for the same call
//! was the same `.extern .func`; the two frontends share `cicc`.
//!
//! So the device text is a JIT unit like every other:
//! `kernels-cuda-new/csrc/src/graph/supergraph.cuh`, fired by
//! [`crate::fire::supergraph`], whose header carries the whole measurement
//! and the one thing it does not show. It lives outside `kernels-cuda` for
//! the reason it always did -- its argument is a conditional handle, a SHELL
//! object, rather than a tensor -- which is now spelled as a family of its
//! own, `graph`, rather than as a `.cu` beside this file.

// ── The unionized supergraph, built on the conditional node above ──

// The unionized supergraph's capture scaffolding.
//
// This is the Rust port of `driver-cuda/csrc/src/batch/supergraph.{cu,hpp}`
// — S2 of the supergraph ladder, and the piece [`crate::device::graph`]'s
// conditional-node primitive was ported to serve.
//
// # What a supergraph is, and what it is not
//
// ONE captured CUDA graph per (R, N) bucket whose attachment branches — the
// declared trace's `GuardPred` vocabulary — are conditional `if` nodes. The
// predicates live in a DEVICE-resident word ([`PredicateWord`]) that the
// replay path updates per fire; a graph-embedded kernel reads a slot and
// arms the conditional handle, so a replay takes the fire's arms with no
// host round-trip and no recapture.
//
// That is not batching. Batching amortises one program over many rows; this
// amortises many *programs* over one capture. Concurrent requests that are
// structurally distinct — differing in hook attachment, mask kind,
// correction arm, depth, LoRA rank — fold into one conditional graph, so the
// operators they share execute exactly once.
//
// # The capture-time dance
//
// Conditional nodes are added to whichever graph is currently capturing, and
// their bodies are filled by capturing a DIFFERENT stream into the body
// graph. So the builder keeps a stack:
//
// * [`SupergraphBuilder::open_cond`] — create the handle on the capturing
//   graph (`cudaStreamGetCaptureInfo` answers for whichever stream is
//   capturing, at any nesting depth), launch the set-cond kernel so it
//   becomes the node's upstream dependency, then insert the conditional node
//   with the running deps;
// * [`SupergraphBuilder::begin_body`] — `cudaStreamBeginCaptureToGraph` on
//   the next pooled depth stream;
// * [`SupergraphBuilder::end_body`] — end that stream's capture;
// * [`SupergraphBuilder::close_cond`] — collapse the outer stream's capture
//   dependencies onto the conditional node, so post-branch work follows the
//   whole branch rather than racing it.
//
// Guard nesting maps to a stack of body captures over the depth-indexed
// stream pool. Nothing here knows about models.
