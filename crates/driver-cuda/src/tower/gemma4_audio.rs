//! The gemma-4 AUDIO tower's host walk — the USM/Conformer encoder.
//!
//! The port of `driver-cuda/csrc/vision/gemma4_audio.cu`'s host half:
//! `run_gemma4_audio`, `encode_gemma4_audio`, the `clin`/`ffn` lambdas, the
//! `DeviceScratch` arena and the stride-62 struct rebuild that
//! `gemma4_towers_c.cpp` did for it. All of it ran on the CPU; none of it is
//! C++ any more.
//!
//! # What the walk is
//!
//! Log-mel features in, soft-token embedding rows out, in four stages:
//!
//! 1. **SSCP** — two `Conv2d(k3, s2, p1)` over (time, freq), each followed by
//!    a LayerNorm over the CHANNEL axis and a ReLU, which is why each conv is
//!    bracketed by a channels-last/channels-first transpose pair. Then a
//!    flatten to `[T2, F2*C1]` and one projection to the tower width.
//! 2. **Twelve conformer blocks**, each a macaron half-FFN, chunked-local
//!    self-attention with a relative-position bias, a light depthwise causal
//!    conv module, a second macaron half-FFN, and a final RMSNorm.
//! 3. **`output_proj`**, a matmul with bias, 1024 → 1536.
//! 4. **The shared embedder** — a parameterless RMSNorm then a projection
//!    into the text width.
//!
//! Thirty-odd launches per layer, all of them JIT'd. The `.cu` said its
//! kernels had already left — *"THE KERNELS ARE NOT HERE. All twelve moved to
//! `vision/gemma4_audio.cuh` in the JIT crate's header tree"* — and what was
//! left compiling was the loop above.
//!
//! # The four grids no rule states, and why that is not a wall
//!
//! Three SSCP kernels launch `dim3((F+15)/16, (T+15)/16, C)`: `Tile16`'s
//! rectangle with a channel count on `grid.z`, which `Dims` has no field for.
//! `k_local_attn` launches `dim3((N+127)/128, NH)`, a TILE count where every
//! ported rule puts a count of things. Neither is a rule this crate may grow
//! — §10.5 forbids growing the vocabulary for one kernel — and neither needs
//! to be: the owner's principle puts the composition in Rust, so **the host
//! computes the grid and the host is here**. Those four rows carry
//! `LaunchRule::Unstated`, every operand sourced, and each fire below quotes
//! the `dim3` it reproduces. [`super::fire_stated`] is the entry;
//! `fire/attn_score.rs` has used that path since before the towers moved.
//!
//! # The thirteenth kernel
//!
//! The depthwise causal conv is not a vision kernel at all — the `.cu` says
//! *"`k_depthwise_causal` is `ssm::device::causal_conv1d_prefill<T, false>`
//! — bit for bit the same accumulation in the same order"*. That template now
//! carries a row of its own (`ssm::causal_conv1d_prefill_noact_bf16`), and
//! `families/ssm.rs` records why it could not have one before: it had no
//! caller. It has one, and the caller is this file.
//!
//! # A failure is a refusal
//!
//! Every `ACK(...)` in the `.cu` threw `std::runtime_error`, and every
//! `throw` in `run_gemma4_audio` crossed the C ABI. Each is a `Result` here.
//! Nothing substitutes a kernel, retries at another geometry, or treats a
//! refused launch as a no-op — the next launch reads the buffer this one was
//! supposed to write.
//!
//! # No numerics moved
//!
//! Unlike the vision tower, this walk's `k_rms` is the tower's OWN
//! `vision::k_rms_bf16` at `<<<N, 256>>>` and `LaunchRule::PerRow` launches
//! `grid[rows] block[256]` — the same grid, the same block. There is no
//! divergence to state here; `super::gemma4_vision`'s 512→256 fold is not
//! repeated because this tower never called `norm::rmsnorm_strided_bf16`.
