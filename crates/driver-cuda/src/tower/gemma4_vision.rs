//! Gemma-4's vision tower: the host walk, in Rust.
//!
//! The port of `driver-cuda/csrc/vision/gemma4_vision.cu` (322 lines) and of
//! `gemma4_towers_c.cpp`'s vision half (52 lines). Both were host C++ over
//! device text that had already moved to
//! `kernels-cuda/kernels/vision/gemma4_vision.cuh`; what is here is that
//! same walk with the `<<<>>>` written by [`super::fire`] instead of by nvcc.
//!
//! # Every launch, and the launcher it reproduces
//!
//! Each fire below quotes the C++ expression it replaces. The rule named in
//! the row was written against that expression — `families/vision.rs` records
//! the check for each — so the comment is the citation the rule's own doc
//! points back at, and a reader can compare the two without a build.
//!
//! Fifteen launches, fourteen of them JIT rows. The fifteenth is
//! `gemm::act_x_wt_bf16`, which is a cuBLAS call with no `<<<>>>` to state: it
//! holds a runtime autotuner that may choose a gemv, and `execution.rs`
//! already calls it `Service::Cublas`. It crosses through the generated
//! `pie_k_*` entry, which is the boundary `fire/lora.rs` and
//! `bind/service.rs` already use for it.
//!
//! # The one numerics divergence, stated rather than buried
//!
//! The C++ `rms()` helper carried a local copy of
//! `norm::rmsnorm_strided_bf16`'s vec8/scalar decision and launched the vec8
//! arm **at block 512**. The JIT row's vec8 specialisation is instantiated at
//! `BLOCK = 256`, and `LaunchRule::Rms` launches 256 threads to match. The
//! DECISION is identical — `families/norm.rs`'s `RMSNORM_STRIDED_VEC8`
//! predicate is `rms_vec8_ok`'s clauses term for term — but the fold is 256
//! wide where it was 512, so the reduction tree differs and the last bit of a
//! row's inverse-RMS can differ with it.
//!
//! §42's parity claim for this tower was BYTE IDENTITY, measured over four
//! shapes and two weight sets, so this is a real change and not a rounding
//! footnote. It is here rather than in a new row because a row instantiated
//! at 512 for one caller is `LaunchRule::Rms` growing a second block width for
//! one tower, which §10.5 forbids. See `super`'s header.
