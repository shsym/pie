//! The thirteen `pie_cuda_*` exports — the cutover's door (retirement
//! plan phase D).
//!
//! The engine consumes a driver through `pie_driver_abi.h`, whose Rust
//! source of truth is `driver_api::local`. This module DEFINES the symbols
//! that crate declares; a test resolving the declaration against these
//! definitions makes the linker prove the contract, the same way the
//! launch bridge's shim makes the C++ compiler prove the rows.
//!
//! **One provider per binary.** The C++ shell this replaced exported the
//! same thirteen names, so the `abi` feature could never be enabled in a
//! build that also linked it — same symbols, duplicate-definition link
//! error, by design rather than by accident. There is one provider now,
//! and the rule survives it: nothing else may define these.
//!
//! # What is in here, and what is next door
//!
//! This file is the DOOR: the thirteen entry points, the panic boundary
//! every one of them crosses (`guard`), and the pointer validation they
//! share (`checked`). The bodies live beside it, one module per thing the
//! driver does:
//!
//! * [`state`] — the shell's nouns. A leaf; everything else calls in.
//! * [`load`] — create, destroy, and the once-per-model work.
//! * [`launch`] — the forward path. `.wiki/driver/graph.md` is about it.
//! * [`encode`] — the multimodal towers, run outside a fire.
//! * [`transfer`] — KV/state copies and pool resizes.
//!
//! It was one 6,364-line file, of which the doors were 18%. The split is
//! by what a caller is asking for, which is also how the work divides:
//! `launch` is `graph.md`'s subject and `state` is nobody's, so they can
//! be edited without meeting.

// Error paths print to stderr with the C++ shell's own prefix — that IS
// the behaviour being replaced (`abi.cpp` writes `[pie-driver-cuda]` to
// cerr), and an ABI boundary has no tracing subscriber to rely on.
#![allow(clippy::print_stderr)]
// Every export takes raw pointers by C-ABI necessity and null-checks them
// before the deref — the same defensive shape the C++ shell has. The
// caller-side contract is `driver_api::local`'s `unsafe extern` block;
// marking the DEFINITIONS `unsafe fn` would change their ABI type for a
// fact the boundary already states.

/// cannot state is one a reviewer has to, and this one can at least be

/// was serving.
