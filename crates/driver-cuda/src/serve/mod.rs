//! The shell's door: the verbs the engine calls, as methods.
//!
//! # What these stopped being
//!
//! Thirteen `pie_cuda_*` free functions, each taking a `*mut PieDriver` —
//! an opaque `c_void` — and casting it back to a `Shell` on entry. The
//! engine reached them through an `unsafe extern "C"` block that the linker
//! resolved against this same crate, in this same workspace, in Rust.
//!
//! The declaration existed because the driver on the far side used to be
//! C++, and it outlived the C++ by the length of the cutover. What it cost
//! while it lived: no type checking across the call, no lifetimes, a
//! `*mut PieDriver` where a `&mut Shell` would do, seven `#[repr(C)]`
//! descriptors built by the engine purely to be taken apart again here, and
//! a null check plus a validator call on every entry — 48 `unsafe` in this
//! module's subtree against the Metal shell's 4, for the same work.
//!
//! They are methods on [`state::Shell`] now. The receiver is the handle, the
//! descriptors are the owned `driver_api` types the engine already had, and
//! the `i32` status they still answer is this crate's own convention rather
//! than an ABI — `engine`'s seam turns it into the verb's name and a message.
//!
//! # What is in here, and what is next door
//!
//! This file is the DOOR: the entry points and the panic boundary every one
//! of them crosses (`guard`). The bodies live beside it, one module per
//! thing the driver does:
//!
//! * [`state`] — the shell's nouns. A leaf; everything else calls in.
//! * [`load`] — create, destroy, and the once-per-model work.
//! * [`launch`] — the forward path. `.wiki/driver/graph.md` is about it.
//! * [`encode`] — the multimodal towers, run outside a fire.
//! * [`transfer`] — KV/state copies and pool resizes.
//!
//! It was one 6,364-line file, of which the doors were 18%. The split is
//! by what a caller is asking for, which is also how the work divides:
//! `launch` is `graph.md`'s subject and `state` is nobody's, so they can
//! be edited without meeting.

// Error paths print to stderr with the C++ shell's own prefix — that IS
// the behaviour being replaced (`abi.cpp` writes `[pie-driver-cuda]` to
// cerr), and a driver has no tracing subscriber to rely on.

/// The thirteen entry points used to be `extern "C"`, where a Rust panic is
/// not a recoverable event: unwinding out of one was undefined behaviour and
/// then, from Rust 1.81, an abort. So the C++ shell's `try/catch` on every
/// export had no counterpart on this side and could not have one -- catching
/// would have to happen INSIDE the frame, which is what this does.

/// They are plain Rust functions now, so a panic unwinds normally into the
/// engine. That makes catching possible; this makes it the contract. Every one
/// of these already answers a status code, and "the driver hit a bug" is a
/// status, not a reason to take the process down with the other requests it
/// was serving.
///
/// **This does not make a panic safe to ignore.** A caught panic means the
/// shell's invariants are in an unknown state -- a half-built plan, a stream
/// with work queued, an arena mid-resize -- so it is reported loudly and the
/// driver should be considered untrustworthy afterwards. What it buys is that
