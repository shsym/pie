//! The fire: one PTIR stage, prepared and launched.
//!
//! # What a fire is made of
//!
//! A generated region's kernel takes sixteen arguments and reads six device
//! buffers. Five of them are built here, per fire, and every one is an array
//! whose stride the kernel computes rather than reads:
//!
//! | buffer | stride the kernel uses | built by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | lane table | `header`, then `lanes[i]`, then `channels[lane * slots + n]` | [`Prepared::table`] |
//! | descriptors | `all_descriptors + lane * value_count` | [`Prepared::descriptors`] |
//! | params | `params[op]` — 88 bytes each, shared by every lane | [`Prepared::params`] |
//! | offsets | `offsets[value]` — shared by every lane | [`Prepared::offsets`] |
//! | scratch | `all_scratch + lane * scratch_stride` | [`Prepared::scratch`] |
//! | pending flags | `pending_flags[lane * slots + n]` | [`Prepared::pending`] |
//!
//! Every one of those strides is a number the host computes and the kernel
//! trusts. There is no length anywhere on the device, so a stride that is too
//! small has each lane reading the previous lane's tail, and a stride that is
//! too large has it reading past the allocation — and only the second one
//! faults.
//!
//! # Scratch is uniform across lanes, and so are the offsets
//!
//! One `offsets` table serves every lane, so a value's offset must be the same
//! in every lane even when the lanes differ in extent. [`Prepared::build`]
//! resolves each lane's descriptors separately and then lays out against the
//! WIDEST descriptor for each value — the same running maximum the C++ takes.
//! Each lane still gets its own descriptor ROW, because the kernel reads
//! `all_descriptors + lane * value_count` and a lane must see its own lengths.
//!
//! # Grouping: the policy question is settled
//!
//! The lanes of a fire MAY be different instances, and the fire is built for
//! that: [`Prepared::build`] takes one [`Lane`] per member — its own rings and
//! its own extents — rather than one ring set and a slice of extents. A
//! caller that grouped instances against a single ring set would have every
//! member reading the first one's cells, which is a wrong answer rather than
//! a fault, because the cells are real and just somebody else's.
//!
//! What settled it was LoRA. Each request's adapter is resolved against that
//! request's instance and its own committed cells
//! (`fire::lora::lane_for_instance`), so "one fire, several instances,
//! several channel sets" is a shape this driver already builds — the sampler
//! is simply the last caller that does not group yet.
//!
//! What is still missing is that caller: `serve`'s `run_program` fires once
//! per request, so today every `Prepared` has one lane. The remaining work is
//! a scheduler decision about which requests batch together, not a layout
//! one.
//!
//! Also the intrinsic side tables beyond binding them empty, and the ticketed
//! channel path.

// # Why the arguments are the whole content of this file
//
// `cuLaunchKernel` takes `void**` — an array of pointers to each argument's
// *storage*, not the argument values. So passing a device pointer means
// taking the address of the variable that holds it, and passing a `u32` means
// taking the address of a `u32` that must outlive the call. Getting that one
// level of indirection wrong does not fail: the driver reads whatever is at
// the address it was given, and the kernel sees a plausible number.
//
// It is also completely unchecked. There is no arity check, no type check,
// and no diagnostic — a sixteen-parameter kernel handed fifteen arguments
// reads its sixteenth from uninitialised memory. So the marshalling lives
// here, in one place, behind [`Args`], and every launcher builds its list
// through it rather than assembling a `Vec<*mut c_void>` at the call site.
//
// # The one-CTA-per-lane rule
//
// A generated fused region is launched with `grid.x = lane_count` and
// `block.x` from the compiled function's own attribute, because the kernel's
// first line is `dispatch_lane = blockIdx.x`. It is not a tuning choice: two
// lanes per block would have both write the same `commit_slot`, and a grid
// smaller than the lane count silently drops the tail lanes.

// ── The control kernels that gate and commit it ──

// The two control kernels: readiness before a pass, the commit bump after it.
//
// # Why these are compiled here rather than linked
//
// The host emitter produces one kind of kernel for CUDA — a fused region per
// generated region — and emits no readiness kernel and no commit kernel,
// because on CUDA those are *prebuilt*. The C++ driver's prebuilt copies live
// in `driver-cuda/csrc/src/pipeline/channels.hpp`, a private header of a
// crate this one is replacing. They are not in `libpie_kernels_cuda.a`: the
// kernel table has no row for them, `kernels-cuda/csrc` includes
// `channels.hpp` nowhere, and `driver-cuda --features bridge` therefore
// links an archive containing neither symbol.
//
// So they have to come from somewhere, and there are two honest options: add
// them to the kernels crate and build them with nvcc, or compile them here
// through the NVRTC path this driver already has for every emitted region.
//
// This file takes the second, and the reason is the toolkit-free build. A
// kernels-crate row would mean `driver-cuda` cannot run a PTIR program
// without `bridge`, which needs nvcc *at build time* — and that build is
// load-bearing for CI. Compiling forty lines through the NVRTC path already
// in `super::nvrtc` costs one compile per process, is cached on disk beside
// every other region, and needs no toolkit at build time at all.
//
// # These are ports and reproduce the C++ exactly
//
// Both bodies are transcriptions of `channels.hpp:93-149`, including the
// `threadIdx.x != 0 || blockIdx.x != 0` guard that makes each a single-thread
// kernel, and including the ORDER of the commit loops — puts before takes.
// The order matters for a channel that is both taken and put in one pass (a
// loop-carried ping-pong): publishing first and consuming second is what
// leaves such a ring with the value the pass produced rather than with the
// one it consumed.
//
// # The types are spelled in bare C
//
// `unsigned char` and `unsigned int`, not `std::uint8_t`/`std::uint32_t`.
// NVRTC compiles these with **no include path at all** — the same condition
// the emitted regions are compiled under — so `<cstdint>` cannot be found and
// `std::` does not exist. The M1 runtime prologue solves the same problem the
// same way, with its `m1_u8`/`m1_u32` typedefs, and says so in its own
// header comment.
