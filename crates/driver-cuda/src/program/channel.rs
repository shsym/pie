//! The device-side channel ring: cells the kernels read and write, and the
//! four cursors the control kernels advance.
//!
//! # Two shapes for one channel, and why
//!
//! A channel's cell exists twice, in two different encodings, and confusing
//! them is the defect this module is written against:
//!
//! * **native**, on the device: one byte per bool lane, four per anything
//!   else. A kernel indexes a bool cell lane by lane, so it cannot be packed.
//! * **wire**, on the host: bool packs eight lanes to a byte
//!   ([`wire_cell_bytes`](driver::wire_cell_bytes)); everything else
//!   is still four bytes per lane.
//!
//! Every non-bool channel therefore has the same size in both, which is
//! exactly why a port can carry the confusion for a long time and only meet it
//! on the first bool channel — where a 128-lane mask is 128 bytes on the
//! device and 16 on the wire, and reading one as the other yields a mask that
//! is one eighth right.
//!
//! # The ring, and the sentinel cell
//!
//! `capacity + 1` slots, and the extra one is load-bearing: full and empty are
//! otherwise the same state (`head == tail`) and cannot be told apart without
//! a separate count. With the sentinel, empty is `head == tail` and full is
//! `(tail + 1) % cap1 == head`, so a capacity-N channel holds at most N
//! unconsumed items and the cursors alone say which.
//!
//! # What lives where
//!
//! | array | element | length | indexed |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | cells | native bytes | `cap1 * native_bytes` per channel | `base + slot * native_bytes` |
//! | `full` | `u8` | `channels * MAX_RING` | `full[c * MAX_RING + slot]` |
//! | `head` | `u32` | `channels` | `head[c]` |
//! | `tail` | `u32` | `channels` | `tail[c]` |
//! | `cap1` | `u32` | `channels` | `cap1[c]` |
//!
//! `full` is indexed with [`MAX_RING`] as its row pitch **whatever a channel's
//! capacity is**. Using `cap1` as the pitch would be the natural-looking
//! mistake and would make every channel past the first read its neighbour's
//! flags.
//!
//! # Everything is zeroed, deliberately
//!
//! A fresh CUDA allocation is not promised zero, and garbage cursors mean a
//! ring that is already mid-sequence, already full, or already poisoned. The
//! Metal port's `Ring::new` records the same requirement for the same reason.

// ── The host plane the device rings above are bridged to ──

// A channel exists twice. `pie_cuda_register_channel` allocates PINNED
// HOST rings — a mirror of `capacity + 1` cells and four `u64` control
// words — and hands their addresses to the engine, which polls them
// directly. [`crate::program::channel::Rings`] allocates DEVICE rings, which is
// what a compiled program's kernels read and write. Nothing joins them,
// which is why `ptir_programs` has a writer and no reader: a program
// could be compiled and could not be handed its inputs.
//
// This is the join, and it is a COPY rather than a mapping. The two
// planes are different memory by construction — the engine must be able
// to poll without a device round-trip, and a kernel must be able to read
// without a host one — so a fire pulls its inputs across before the
// stages and pushes its outputs back after.
//
// # The bool encoding is the whole subtlety
//
// `ptir/mod.rs` names it and this is where it lands: *"Native bytes on
// the device, bit-packed on the wire, and the difference is invisible
// until the first bool channel."* A `[64]` bool cell is 64 bytes in a
// device ring and 8 bytes in the host mirror. Every other dtype is four
// bytes per lane on both sides, so a bridge that forgot this would be
// right for f32, i32 and u32 — which is to say, right until the first
// program that compares anything.
//
// The packing is LSB-first within each byte, which is what
// `register_channel` sizes for (`numel.div_ceil(8)`) and what the engine
// reads. Neither side stores anything in the padding bits of the last
// byte, so the round trip is exact rather than merely lossless.
