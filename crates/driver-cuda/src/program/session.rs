//! One instance's fire: the rings, the control kernels, and the sequence.
//!
//! Every piece of firing a PTIR program existed before this module and
//! nothing put them in order. `Runtime::compile` turns a plan into cubins,
//! `Prepared::build` lays out a stage's device state, `launch_control`
//! gates on the cursors, and [`super::bridge`] moves values between the
//! host mirror the engine polls and the device rings the kernels read.
//! What was missing is the thing that holds them for the length of an
//! instance and runs them in the one order that works.
//!
//! # What a session owns, and why it is per instance
//!
//! The rings are sized from the instance's OWN channels, in the order its
//! `channel_ids` lists them, because a program names a channel by index
//! into that list. So they cannot be shared and cannot be rebuilt per
//! fire — rebuilding would zero the cursors, and a cursor is the only
//! record of what a previous fire published.
//!
//! The control modules are the opposite: they depend on the architecture
//! and nothing else, so they are compiled once and shared. They are
//! borrowed rather than owned here for exactly that reason.
//!
//! # The order, and what each step is for
//!
//! ```text
//!   pull      host mirror -> device rings, for everything the stage reads
//!   readiness the inputs hold values and the outputs have room
//!   bind      the logits buffer, per lane, into the intrinsic tables
//!   launch    one region at a time, in the order the stage states them
//!   commit    the verdict the kernel wrote, then the cursors
//!   push      device rings -> host mirror, for everything it published
//! ```
//!
//! Readiness is not a formality. A fire launched without asking reads the
//! ZEROED cell and publishes a confident answer computed from nothing,
//! which is the failure this whole driver keeps choosing to refuse
//! instead.
