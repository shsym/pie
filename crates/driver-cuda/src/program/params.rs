//! The device records, in CUDA's spelling.
//!
//! # Why this file exists at all
//!
//! [`driver_pipeline`] mirrors three structs the emitted kernels read:
//! `Status` (16 bytes), `ValueDesc` (36) and `OpParams` (64). Two of those are
//! byte-identical to what CUDA's generated kernels declare and cross as
//! themselves. The third is not, and the difference is not a detail:
//!
//! | record | Metal / `driver-pipeline` | CUDA `M1OpParams` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Status` | 16 B | 16 B — identical |
//! | `ValueDesc` | 36 B | 36 B — identical |
//! | `OpParams` | **64 B**, sixteen `u32` | **88 B**, twenty `u32` + one `u64` |
//!
//! `driver-pipeline`'s own comment says why it is sixteen: *"Sixteen words is
//! the agreement with the emitted kernels."* That is Metal's agreement. CUDA's
//! `ptir_m1_runtime_prologue.cuh` declares the same sixteen words **in the
//! same order** and then four more — `intrinsic_dtype`, `bool_storage`,
//! `intrinsic_row_stride`, `intrinsic_row_offset` — followed by a `u64`
//! `rng_seed`, whose alignment is what makes the record 88 and not 84.
//!
//! # Why widening, and not a second mirror in the shared crate
//!
//! The shared crate could have carried the union of both layouts, and that
//! would be worse. `OpParams::of` is where an op's *meaning* is decided —
//! which slot is the predicate, what a result-less op points its output at —
//! and that reasoning is identical on both backends and belongs in one place.
//! The extra five fields are not meaning; they are CUDA's binding of the
//! intrinsic side tables. So the shared crate keeps the decision, and this
//! file keeps the encoding, and [`CudaOpParams::widen`] is the seam.
//!
//! # The hazard this is written against
//!
//! Two records whose first sixteen words agree and whose sizes differ is the
//! worst shape a layout bug can take: writing 64 bytes into an 88-byte stride
//! leaves every op after the first reading its predecessor's tail as its own
//! head, and every field is a plausible small integer. Nothing faults. The
//! kernel samples a wrong token and the model still speaks fluently. So the
//! offsets here are asserted individually rather than the size being asserted
//! once — a size check passes under any permutation of same-width fields.
