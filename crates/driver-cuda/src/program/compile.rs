//! NVRTC: one self-contained translation unit in, one cubin out.
//!
//! # Why there is no include path
//!
//! `nvrtcCreateProgram` is called with zero headers and zero include names,
//! and that is not an omission. The host emitter (`tensor-compiler`) splices
//! `ptir_m1_runtime_prologue.cuh`, `fused_block0.cuh`, the entry name,
//! `fused_block1.cuh`, `fused_block2.cuh` and the generated body into ONE
//! string before the driver ever sees it, and the runtime headers say so about
//! themselves — *"these headers are compiled with no include path at all"*.
//! So a `#include` appearing in an emitted source is a bug in the emitter, and
//! the right place to find that out is a compile error rather than a search
//! path that silently resolves it against whatever CUDA toolkit is installed.
//!
//! It is also what makes this crate's toolkit-free build survive: there is no
//! header to find at build time, and `libnvrtc.so` is resolved by `dlopen` on
//! first call like every other CUDA symbol here.
//!
//! # Why the real architecture and not a virtual one
//!
//! `--gpu-architecture=sm_XY`, from the live device, so NVRTC returns a cubin.
//! `compute_XY` would return PTX, and PTX is JIT-compiled a second time by the
//! driver — which is outside CUDA minor-version compatibility and would force
//! every host to carry a driver at least as new as the toolkit pie was built
//! against. The C++ shell says the same thing at `module_cache.hpp:196-202`
//! and this reproduces it.
//!
//! # The three float flags are a contract, not a tuning knob
//!
//! `--fmad=false --prec-div=true --prec-sqrt=true`. The channel plane's whole
//! claim is that a replay lands on the same token, and
//! `driver-pipeline`'s tolerance contract holds magnitudes to one ulp *and
//! argmax indices to zero*. Contracting a multiply-add, or taking a fast
//! reciprocal, moves a lane by more than that and turns a tie into a different
//! winner. These flags are what make the CPU interpreter and the GPU agree.

// The generated fused kernels reduce with the standard halving tree —
// `for (stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride > 0; stride >>= 1)`. A tree written
// that way is correct only when `blockDim.x` is a power of two; at 768
// threads the first halving is 384, the second 192, and the lanes at the top
// of the block are folded twice while the ones in the middle are never folded
// at all. The answer is wrong and nothing reports it.
//
// So the launch width is not a tuning constant. It is
// `CU_FUNC_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK` — what the compiled function's
// register pressure actually permits — rounded DOWN to a power of two. Down,
// because rounding up is a launch failure, and the attribute is a ceiling.
//
// # Why the module is owned rather than leaked
//
// `CUmodule` is a process-wide resource and a program that is registered,
// bound, and closed a thousand times over a serving day leaks a thousand of
// them. [`Module`] unloads in `Drop`, which is the whole reason the cubin is
// wrapped at all instead of being loaded inline where it is compiled.
