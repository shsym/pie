// The SSA VALUE ARENA — where a traced value's buffer comes from.
//
// The trace is pure SSA: `rmsnorm(x: &Val) -> Val`, and every op carries
// its `inputs` / `outputs` as value ids. What it deliberately does NOT
// carry is a buffer, because choosing one is a BACKEND job. Both family
// executors did that job as convention — "the normed activation lives in
// `ws.norm_y`" here, "in `ws.norm_x`" there — and since an arm then has to
// know whose convention it is serving, the executor could not be one file.
// (Measured at the start of this merge: the SSA edges are read 1 and 0
// times across the two executors; workspace fields are read 82 and 110.)
//
// This is the other answer: a value gets a slot, the arm asks for the slot
// by value id, and which physical bytes those are stops being anyone's
// convention.
//
// WHO CHOOSES THE BYTES: the HOST does, and this file no longer does.
//
// It used to. It walked the plan for last-use, kept a free list, and
// bump-allocated on first ask — the same job `Buffers::assign` does in
// `model-compiler/src/lower.rs`. Two allocators over one plan have to
// agree byte-for-byte forever, and these two already did not: this copy
// predates `Select` (a value that IS a window of another's bytes), the
// `kernel!` in-place table (an output that IS the operand it accumulates
// into) and `Dim::MoeAlignedRoutes` (a padded extent it cannot size). On
// a text using any of the three it placed or sized a value differently,
// and silently, because an allocator that hands back a plausible pointer
// reports nothing.
//
// So the host assigns and this maps. `PieForwardLowered::value_offsets`
// is a byte offset per value id, `arena_bytes` is the block they need,
// and `slot()` is an add. Everything the old allocator knew — liveness,
// reuse, alignment, the union of values that share bytes — is decided
// once on the host, where it is tested (`model/tests/arena_soundness.rs`
// walks a write trace per family and fails if any value lands on bytes a
// later op still reads). A mapper cannot notice an overlapping
// assignment, which is exactly why the overlap has to be impossible
// there rather than caught here.
//
// CAPTURE SAFETY comes out of the same change for free. A decode body
// runs inside `cudaStreamBeginCapture`, so it must allocate nothing and
// a value must land at the same address on every fire. That used to hold
// because the ask ORDER was deterministic — an emergent property, true
// until an arm asked in a different order. Now the address is a function
// of the plan and the fire's extents, so it is structural.
//
// PINS stay, for the values the host declines to place: the buffer some
// machinery OUTSIDE the traced ops reaches by name — LoRA captures the
// normed activation's pointer at fire setup, hook sites observe the
// query buffer, the sampler reads the logits. The host marks those
// `NAMED` off the SEAM statements, so which values they are is stated in
// the declaration rather than listed per family, and the pass that binds
// them is the only family-shaped thing left here.
//
// MIGRATION: arms move onto the arena one dataflow island at a time. An
// arm that has not moved keeps its convention, and the two coexist —
// which is only sound while every producer and consumer of a given value
// have moved TOGETHER. That is why the islands are converted whole.
