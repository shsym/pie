// the prompt attended to, on the theory that the tail is the best available
// proxy for what the not-yet-generated continuation will attend to.

// So this records the last `window` query rows and folds over both heads and
// window rows, publishing the same `AttentionScores` shape the decode capture
// does. A program cannot tell which one produced its row, which is the point:
// `AttnScore` means "how much attention did each live KV position receive",
// and that is well-defined at both stages.
//
// The observation window is the last `window` rows OF THIS FORWARD CHUNK. For a
// one-shot prefill that is the last `window` tokens of the prompt, which is
// SnapKV's definition. For a chunked prefill the hook fires once per chunk and
// the final firing is the one whose window matches SnapKV; earlier firings are
// well-defined observations of earlier windows, so a policy that simply acts on
// the most recent firing gets SnapKV's semantics for free.
