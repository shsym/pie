// A bounded slab of group instances, paged in on demand.
//
// It holds *several* groups, not one, and that is forced by the contract
// vocabulary rather than chosen: a name template carries one `{}`, so a
// checkpoint that names its experts `layers.<L>.experts.<E>.w1` is L groups of
// arity E, not one group of arity L*E. The slab has to span them anyway --
// budgeting per layer would size every layer for its worst step -- so the key
// here is (group, instance) flattened, and every group must agree on the slot
// stride, which for a real architecture they do because every layer's experts
// have the same shape.
//
// The loader compiles a group to one plan plus `arity` source bindings and
// says nothing about residency, because running the plan `arity` times into
// `arity` destinations and running it on demand into a few slots are the same
// program. This is the second reading. `GroupSlotIndex` decides which instance
// goes where; this moves the bytes and hands back the tensors.
//
// Two facts from the loader's uniformity proof do all the work here:
//
//   * every instance's plan has the same `memory.persistent_bytes`, so one
//     slot stride serves all of them, and the slab is just `slots × stride`;
//   * every instance's buffers land at the same offsets within that arena, so
//     a slot's tensor pointers are fixed at slot creation and a page-in
//     changes only the bytes behind them. A caller that captured a pointer
//     while its instance was resident is safe for exactly as long as the pin
//     lasts, and no longer -- which is what `end_batch` marks.
//
// Because a slot's plan is a whole `LoadPlanView`, the executor that runs the
// resident load runs it verbatim: transforms, tile maps and casts all work on
// the page-in path, and nothing here needs to know what the group contains.
//
// Single-threaded, like the forward pass that calls it. `ensure_resident`
// blocks until the instance is there.
