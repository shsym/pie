//! The `local` → `plan` direction: a C launch package, adopted into an owned one.
//!
//! This crate carries the same program in two shapes. [`local::PieLaunchPackage`]
//! is what actually crosses the C ABI — flat `#[repr(C)]` records whose every
//! list is a `{ptr, len}` pair into memory the host owns, valid only for the
//! duration of the registration call. [`plan::LaunchPackage`] is the owned
//! counterpart, `Vec`s and `String`s a driver can keep for the life of the
//! program. This module is the only thing that turns the first into the second.
//!
//! # What was missing without it
//!
//! A driver's `register_program` entry point receives a
//! [`local::PieProgramDesc`] and nothing else. Every Rust consumer of a launch
//! package — `driver::adopt_launch_package`, the region and lane
//! derivations the CUDA and Metal shells share, the emitted-kernel index —
//! reads [`plan::LaunchPackage`]. With no bridge between them a Rust driver
//! could not register a PTIR program at all: it held the package in the one
//! shape nothing could read. The C++ driver had the bridge
//! (`pie::driver_api::launch::adopt`, in `driver/launch/program.hpp`) and Rust did
//! not.
//!
//! # Why it lives here and not in a driver crate
//!
//! Both representations are defined in this crate, so a conversion between
//! them is this crate's business — putting it in a driver would mean each
//! driver either writing its own copy or depending on whichever one wrote it
//! first, and a per-driver copy of a field-for-field mapping is a per-driver
//! opportunity to drop a field.
//!
//! It is also why only *this* direction is here. The reverse
//! (`engine/src/driver/launch_abi.rs`) cannot be: materialising a C view means
//! keeping the record arrays alive somewhere for as long as the descriptor is
//! read, so it needs an owner with a lifetime — a borrow type the caller holds.
//! Adoption allocates and hands the result back, so it needs nothing but the
//! two type definitions, both of which are here.
//!
//! # `launch_abi.rs` is the authority on the mapping
//!
//! That file builds a `PieLaunchPackage` from a `LaunchPackage`, field by
//! field, and this module is it read backwards. A field left at its default
//! here is not a compile error and not a test failure anywhere else — it is a
//! program that runs with a channel unbound, a region's schedule mis-chosen or
//! an op's third immediate lost — so the round-trip test below asserts a whole
//! non-default package against itself rather than spot-checking members.
//!
//! The C++ predecessor is not the model, for the reason that test exists: its
//! `Trace` stopped at values, channels, names, ports and stages, never looked
//! at `plans` at all, and its `Op` had no field for an op's `intrinsic`, its
//! `lit_dtype`/`lit_bits` or its `channel` — so those were dropped silently,
//! because a destination that lacks a field cannot complain about one.
//! Adopting into [`plan`][crate::plan]'s own types means the destination has a
//! field for everything the source carries, and the compiler says so.
//!
//! # Nothing here may panic
//!
//! Adoption runs inside a driver's `extern "C"` registration entry point. A
//! panic that reaches an `extern "C"` frame **aborts the process** — it does
//! not unwind into the host and it cannot become a `PieStatus` — so the whole
//! host, every other program and every other device context would die because
//! one name had a stray byte or one count was too large. Hence
//! [`String::from_utf8_lossy`] rather than `from_utf8().unwrap()`, a clamp
//! rather than a slice index in `adopt_source_ops`, and a null check rather
//! than a bare [`std::slice::from_raw_parts`] in `slice_of`.
//!
