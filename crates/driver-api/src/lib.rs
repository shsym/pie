//! The runtime ↔ driver vocabulary — what the two sides say to each other.
//!
//! Both drivers are Rust and both are called directly, so there is no ABI
//! here and no longer a crate named for one.
//!
//! It is `driver-api` rather than `driver` because it is not driver-common:
//! nine crates depend on it and five of them are not drivers at all
//! (`engine`, `transport`, `controller-api`, `worker`, `tensor-compiler`).
//! A crate both sides speak is a CONTRACT; the substrate only drivers use is
//! `driver`, which is what that name is now for.
//!
//! What is left is the vocabulary the engine and the drivers say the same
//! things in:
//!
//! - [`local`]: the fire descriptors — a step, a frame, a program, a channel.
//!   Still `#[repr(C)]` and still `{ptr, len}` where a slice would do, which
//!   is the shape they took when they crossed a C boundary. Nothing crosses
//!   one now; converting them to borrowed Rust is a mechanical sweep over
//!   ~65 construction sites in `engine`, `driver-cuda-new` and
//!   `driver-dummy`, and it is the next step rather than this one.
//! - [`adopt`]: the [`local`] → [`plan`] direction, copying a borrowed launch
//!   package into the owned one a driver keeps for the life of the program.
//!   It survives exactly as long as `local`'s borrowed shape does.
//! - [`capabilities`]: what a driver answers at create and load time.
//! - [`transfer`]: the KV transfer vocabulary shared with cross-node transport.
//! - [`plan`]: owned verb plans shared by local and remote backends.
//! - [`remote`]: the versioned worker-to-executor protocol.
//!
//! The C header this crate used to generate, the `unsafe extern "C"` block
//! that declared thirteen `pie_cuda_*` symbols, and the cbindgen binary that
//! wrote the header are all gone with the C++ drivers they served.
