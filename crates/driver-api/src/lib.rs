//! The runtime ↔ driver contract — what the two sides say to each other, and
//! what a driver promises.
//!
//! Both drivers are Rust and both are called directly, so there is no ABI
//! here and no longer a crate named for one.
//!
//! It is `driver-api` rather than `driver` because it is not driver-common:
//! nine crates depend on it and five of them are not drivers at all
//! (`engine`, `transport`, `controller-api`, `worker`, `tensor-compiler`).
//! A crate both sides speak is a CONTRACT; the substrate only drivers use is
//! `driver`, which is what that name is now for.
//!
//! # The promise, and where it moved from
//!
//! [`Driver`] is the contract itself: fourteen verbs one execution device
//! answers. It was an `enum` in `engine` — `DriverBackend`, fourteen `match`es
//! over five variants, **seventy arms that all forwarded** — because a C++
//! shell behind a `*mut PieDriver` cannot implement a trait. The arms are
//! gone and so is the reason they existed; see [`driver`] for what the shape
//! was costing besides lines.
//!
//! Three things had to move here for the trait to be statable, and each was
//! already contract rather than engine:
//!
//! - [`completion`] — a driver MINTS a completion (its `launch` returns one),
//!   so the broker that mints them is vocabulary, not scheduler internals.
//! - [`instance`] — the bind plan and the handle a driver answers with.
//! - [`channel`] — the seed value a bind carries and the registration a
//!   driver answers. The `ChannelEndpoint` an application holds stayed in
//!   `engine`: no verb here takes one.
//!
//! # The rest of the vocabulary
//!
//! - [`local`]: the five records a driver answers with, and the constants
//!   both sides name. It was twenty-eight `#[repr(C)]` descriptors; the
//!   header there says what happened to the other twenty-three.
//! - [`capabilities`]: what a driver answers at create and load time.
//! - [`transfer`]: the KV transfer vocabulary shared with cross-node transport.
//! - [`plan`]: owned verb plans shared by local and remote backends.
//! - [`submission`]: the sealed frame a `launch` takes.
//! - [`remote`]: the versioned worker-to-executor protocol.
//!
//! The C header this crate used to generate, the `unsafe extern "C"` block
//! that declared thirteen `pie_cuda_*` symbols, and the cbindgen binary that
//! wrote the header are all gone with the C++ drivers they served.
