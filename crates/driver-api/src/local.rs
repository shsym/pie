//! The records a driver ANSWERS with, and the constants both sides name.
//!
//! # What this module stopped being
//!
//! It was "direct local FFI descriptors for embedded CUDA and Metal drivers":
//! twenty-eight `#[repr(C)]` structs, four `{ptr, len}` slice views, an opaque
//! `PieDriver = c_void`, an `unsafe extern "C"` notify callback, and seven
//! validators whose job was to check that a foreign caller had filled them in.
//! Every one of those existed because the driver on the far side was C++.
//!
//! None of them is. `driver-cuda` was the last shell reached through a C
//! linkage — thirteen `pie_cuda_*` free functions and a `*mut PieDriver` — and
//! it is a Rust type with Rust methods now, so the descriptors it took apart
//! with `slice_of` are the owned types in [`plan`](crate::plan) and
//! [`submission`](crate::submission) that the engine already had. A round trip
//! through `#[repr(C)]` between two Rust crates in one workspace bought
//! nothing and cost the types.
//!
//! # What is left, and why each one is
//!
//! Five records and the constants. They survive because they are genuinely
//! shared vocabulary rather than a marshalling shape:
//!
//! - [`TerminalCell`] — a location two threads share. It keeps `#[repr(C)]`
//!   and it is the only survivor that earns it: `StepSubmission::terminal_cells`
//!   holds `*mut TerminalCell`, `worker`'s executor holds a `Vec` of them, and
//!   a driver publishes into one while the engine reads it. The `AtomicU32`
//!   inside is what makes that sentence checkable.
//! - [`ChannelBinding`] and [`InstanceBinding`] — what a driver ANSWERS from
//!   `register_channel` and `bind_instance`. All four device drivers name
//!   both, which is what makes them vocabulary; the descriptors they used to
//!   answer *to* are gone.
//! - [`KvMoveCell`], [`StateCopyRange`], [`PoolRange`] — the rows inside a
//!   copy or resize plan. `serde`-derived, because the remote protocol carries
//!   them to another node.
//!
//! The `#[repr(C)]` on the last four is gone: nothing lays them out for a
//! foreign reader any more, and leaving the attribute on would have been a
//! claim about a boundary that no longer exists.
//!
//! The validators went the same way. Five of the seven checked descriptors
//! that no longer exist; the two that remain
//! ([`validate_channel_endpoint_binding`], [`validate_instance_binding`])
//! check what a DRIVER answered, which is the direction the type system
//! cannot check and therefore the only direction still worth a validator.

/// roster, WorkingSet page translation, frame-union KV admission demand) are
/// hoisted out of the per-step sections. Admission is folded into the launch
/// call itself ([`PIE_STATUS_EXHAUSTED`] / [`PIE_STATUS_IMPOSSIBLE`]); the
/// v12 prepare/lease surface and the v13 `settle_defer` lever are deleted.
///
/// v17 (phase 3′): `PieProgramDesc::region_analysis` — the per-region bind
/// verdicts and intrinsic side-table analysis the CUDA driver derives for
/// itself in `region_support.hpp`. Additive, and empty means "not supplied",
/// but the struct grew, so drivers and workers ship together.
/// v21: `LaunchPlan::rs_buffer_read_*` — the buffered prefix a fire must
/// REPLAY before its own tokens, so a recurrence can start from
/// `folded ⊕ replay(buffer)` instead of only from the folded boundary.
/// Separate from the write CSR because a write may allocate a slab and a read
/// must not. Additive, and an empty read side means "nothing to replay", but
/// the struct grew, so drivers and workers ship together.
/// v22: `LaunchPlan::rs_buffer_heads` — where each row's logical buffer
/// token 0 physically sits. A fold absorbs tokens off the front of the buffer
/// but can only release WHOLE covered pages, and `fold_granularity` is 1 while
/// a buffer page is the KV page size, so a fold routinely lands mid-page and
/// the survivors keep their offsets. Every buffer span the driver walks is
/// therefore `head + logical`. Zero for a buffer that was never partially
/// folded, which is why this was invisible until the replay path landed.
/// v23: `PIE_RS_FLAG_BUFFER_WRITE` — a new bit in `rs_slot_flags` marking a
/// row whose buffer span is a WRITE. Orthogonal to `PIE_RS_FLAG_FOLD`: a pass
/// may scatter its own tokens into the buffer AND fold a prefix of the result
/// in one go, and the two flags together are what tell a write-and-fold (run
/// the extended `[buffered | new]` layout, snapshot the state at
/// `rs_fold_lens[r]`) apart from a pure commit (whose rows ARE the replay).
/// No struct grew, but an older driver rejects the unknown bit, so drivers and
/// workers ship together.
/// v24: `PIE_RS_FLAG_FOLD_LEN_DEVICE` — a new bit in `rs_slot_flags` marking a
/// row whose fold length the WORKER DOES NOT KNOW. The value lives in the
/// `rs_fold_len` descriptor port, which the driver resolves at compose time,
/// so a speculative decode's accepted count never has to round-trip through
/// the host between the fire that computes it and the fire that folds it.
/// `rs_fold_lens[r]` is a placeholder for such a row and MUST be ignored; the
