/// What a normalized value is *about*, coarsely.
///
/// Read for meaning by nothing — no emitter, planner or driver branches on it.
/// It is not dead, though, and deleting it is not a cleanup: it is hashed into
/// [`StageSignature`](super::signature::StageSignature), whose hash becomes the
/// emitted kernel's entry-point name (`crate::codegen::program`) and the driver's
/// pipeline cache key (`launch::build`). So its only observable effect is to
/// make two stages that agree on every op and type, but disagree here, compile
/// to differently named kernels that the driver caches apart.
///
/// `the_signature_still_depends_on_value_domains` pins that, because the
/// effect is invisible from this file: the only other thing that would notice
/// is a golden kernel name, and by then the cause is twenty files away.
/// Changing what `value_domain` returns renames kernels, so it is a decision
/// to be argued rather than a diff to be accepted.
///
/// Two rough edges are recorded rather than fixed. `PageDescriptor` and
/// `EffectToken` are never produced, and `LibraryResult` claims four of the
/// seven ops `region::library_op_for_tag` calls library — cumsum, cumprod and
/// sink_call fall through to `PerRow`.
///
/// The first of those is checked rather than merely asserted:
/// `only_six_of_the_eight_domains_are_reachable` enumerates `value_domain`
/// over every op the table declares, so the two unused variants cannot quietly
/// gain a producer, nor a used one quietly lose its last. A prose claim about
/// reachability reads identically whether or not it is still true, which is
/// why it is not left as one. The discriminants are explicit, so retiring the
/// two unused variants leaves `LibraryResult = 6` where it is and moves no
