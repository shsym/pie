//! Cluster state, owned solely by the actor ([`crate::actor`]); no locks, no
//! sharing. Internal types that never cross the wire — the actor publishes
//! the `controller_api` wire views ([`Neighbors`], [`RoutingTable`]) derived
//! from this state.
//!
//! Two monotonic epochs version two full snapshots: `worker_epoch` tags the
//! worker-facing topology, `gateway_epoch` the gateway-facing routing table.
//! Membership changes bump both; a load-bucket crossing bumps only the
//! gateway epoch. An epoch versions a whole snapshot, never a delta.
