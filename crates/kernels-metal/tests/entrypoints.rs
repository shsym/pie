//! The table's product, against itself and against the shader paths.
//!
//! This is invariant (1) of `.wiki/kernel-metal-refactor.md` §6:
//!
//! > every entrypoint in `kernels/` resolves to exactly one (row, axis point),
//! > and every (row, axis point) to exactly one entrypoint
//!
//! It is no longer checked here. The shader half of the comparison needed a C
//! preprocessor — the axis product lives in `instantiate_*` macros and nothing
//! else writes it down — so it arrived as a committed
//! `entrypoints.generated.txt` that `scripts/metal-kernel-audit.py` wrote and
//! this file diffed against the table. That artifact is deleted, and with it
//! the only hermetic view a `cargo test` had of what the shaders instantiate.
//!
//! The Vulkan and WGSL siblings kept their halves of the same invariant, and
//! the difference is the shading language rather than the effort: there a
//! variant is DECLARED on a `// pie:instantiate` line, so the set is a parse.
//! Here it is a macro expansion. `scripts/metal-kernel-audit.py --table` was
//! the way to compare the two sets, and it is retired — it read the table's
//! half by running `examples/entrypoints.rs`, which is deleted with the rest
//! of `examples/`. Nothing compares them now, in a test or out of one.
//!
//! What still holds below is everything that reads the table, the routine name
//! tables, and the shader tree's file names: a typo in a hand-written routine
//! spelling is still red here rather than a nil pipeline on a device. What is
//! NOT held is the set itself — a shader instantiating a name no row declares,
//! or a row whose axes over-generate one no shader stamps, is green
//! everywhere.

/// Census names that no body in this crate fires.
///
/// Each is compiled by `device_kernels.rs` and dispatched by nothing, which is
/// a real cost — a pipeline built per device for a shader that never runs —
/// and each is deliberate. All four are explained where they are:
///
/// - `sdpa_paged_decode_bfloat16_d_{64,128}_p32` and `_d_64_p32_sg8` set
///   `FAST_FULL`, which deletes the window and all three mask operands from
///   the body; `attn.rs`'s [`PAGED_DECODE`] omits them and a test beside it
///   asserts the omission, so a fire that reached one would pass masks to a
///   kernel that has none.
/// - `silu_mul_strided_bfloat16` is the one of `mlp.rs`'s five that did not
///   cross. The reason was once the argument vocabulary — it declares
///   `row_pitch` at buffer 4 with buffer 3 empty, and a positional list could
///   not express a hole — and `pad` answered that; twenty-one routines now bind
///   an address at an index their shader does not declare. What keeps it dark
///   is that no text names it and no statement produces a row pitch, which is
///   what `driver-metal`'s `DARK` says.
///
/// The list being SHORT is the point. Every name on it is a shader compiled on
/// every device for nothing, so it should shrink as the vocabulary grows, and
/// a name arriving here without a reason written down is a routine that was
/// deleted while its census row stayed.
