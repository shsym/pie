//! The table's product, against the shader tree.
//!
//! This is invariant (1) of `.wiki/kernel-metal-refactor.md` §6:
//!
//! > every entrypoint in `kernels/` resolves to exactly one (row, axis point),
//! > and every (row, axis point) to exactly one entrypoint
//!
//! The comparison runs in two hops, and the split is not incidental. Expanding
//! an `instantiate_*` macro needs a C preprocessor, which a `cargo test` should
//! not shell out to — so `scripts/metal-kernel-audit.py` does that half and
//! writes `entrypoints.generated.txt`, and this test does the half that must be
//! hermetic and fast. The same shape as the RNG contract's generated artifacts
//! and for the same reason.
//!
//! When a shader changes, both hops fail and they fail in a useful order:
//! `--check` names the entrypoint that appeared or vanished, and this test then
//! says whether the table has a row for it.
