//! The handle vocabulary: runtime-typed, `Copy`, and never dereferenced.
//!
//! The old plane spoke `Tensor<T>` — a `u32` buffer handle behind a phantom
//! scalar, with rows/width riding on the `In`/`Out`/`InOut` marks around it.
//! Here the type parameter is erased into a [`Dtype`] field and the marks'
//! extents fold onto the handle itself; nothing else is added. The old
//! handle carried no stride or offset (its regions were always dense,
//! `stride == width`), so none are carried here either.
//!
//! One convention, stated once: **outputs are passed by value too.** A handle
//! names GPU memory the host never dereferences, so `&`/`&mut` would be
//! intent the borrow checker cannot enforce — read/write intent is recorded
//! where it is real, in the argument marshalling ([`Tensor::arg`] vs
//! [`Tensor::arg_mut`]).
