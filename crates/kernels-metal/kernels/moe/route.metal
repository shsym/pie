// Generic MoE routing: select experts, group rows by expert, and combine them.
//
// A mixture's problem at prefill is not arithmetic, it is that every (token,
// slot) pair reads a DIFFERENT expert's weight matrix. The matvec form pays
// that literally: `rows * experts_per_token` matvecs, each re-reading a whole
// [N, K] stack slice, so a 512-token prefill reads the same 128 experts four
// thousand times. Nothing about the shape improves with the batch, which is
// exactly what the measurements said -- our routed prefill was flat in length
// where mlx-lm's climbed.
//
// The fix is not a wider kernel. It is to put the rows that share an expert
// NEXT TO EACH OTHER, at which point the projection is an ordinary batched
// matmul over a contiguous block of rows against one weight slice -- the
// `affine_qmm_t` this driver already has. The reordering is:
//
//   sort    -- a counting sort of the (row, slot) pairs by expert id, laid out
//              so each expert's run starts on a tile boundary.
//   gather  -- copy each sorted position's source row into that order.
//
// There is no third kernel putting the results back. The sort emits the INVERSE
// permutation alongside the forward one -- it knows both, at no cost, at the
// moment it places a pair -- and the combine step reads its k slots through it.
// Undoing a permutation to feed a kernel that is about to gather anyway is a
// dispatch and a full-width buffer spent to make an index arithmetic look
// simpler.
//
// Sort and gather also run at M=1. A decode handles eight pairs, which is
// microseconds -- and it means the routed
// dataflow has ONE shape rather than a decode shape and a prefill shape that
// have to be kept agreeing. The batched and unbatched paths differ in exactly
// one number, `tile_rows`: 1 leaves the sort a pure grouping with no padding
// and the projections stay matvecs; 16 rounds every expert's run up to a tile
// and they become matmuls.

// `router_topk` took a `constant RouterParams&`, `route_sort` and
// `route_gather` a `constant MoeRouteParams&`, and `combine_sorted` a
// `constant ExpertCombineParams&` -- one buffer each, holding every field, at
// the address of the statement's staged scalar run. That is where the tree's
// packed-params convention came from and it is the convention being unwound:
// a struct pointer is one slot for many numbers, so nothing between the text
// and the shader could name any single one of them, and a text that stated
// FEWER words than the struct declares was undetectable. It happened here.
// `driver-metal/tests/packed_params_cover_the_struct.rs` exists because
// `RouterParams` is four `unsigned int` and a text stated two: this file read
// `p.softmax_over_all` at byte 8 and `p.logits_pitch` at byte 12 out of the
// NEXT dispatch's scalars, which is a routing that softmaxes over all experts
// because a neighbouring statement's first word happened to be nonzero, and a
// logits stride taken from its second. Both produce weights and neither
// faults.
//
// Every field is a `const constant uint&` of its own now, one `setBytes` each
// where the block was one address, at ascending buffer indices AFTER this
// kernel's real operands -- which is how `driver-metal`'s `lay_out` numbers a
// routine's arguments: an argument's slot is its position in the list the body
// fired. The routines state one `Const<u32>` mark per field, in the struct's
// order, because that order is the statement's: word 0 of `route_sort`'s run
// is `n` on every plane and always was.
//
// Deleting a block from the MIDDLE of an operand list renumbers what follows
// it, and three of these four sat in the middle. `per_expert_scale`, and both
// `inv`s, each moved down one; each says so where it is declared.

// Top-k over each router-logit row, then a softmax over only the selected

// ── The shared expert ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every routed member of this family -- Qwen3-Next-80B, Qwen3.5-35B-A3B,
// Qwen3.5-122B-A10B -- runs one DENSE FFN beside the routed bank on every
// token, and adds it to the mixture's output under a learned gate:
//
//   y = routed + sigmoid(shared_expert_gate(x)) * shared_expert(x)
//
// The FFN half needs nothing new -- it is the same three projections and the
// same SwiGLU the dense members of this family already run, at
// `shared_expert_intermediate_size`. Only this last line is new, and it is new
// for one reason: the gate is ONE number per token, broadcast across the whole
// hidden row. `attn_gate` looks like it would serve and does not; its gate is
// full width, so it would read `hidden` gate values where there is one.
//
// Fused rather than a multiply and an add, because the alternative writes the
// scaled shared output to a full-width scratch buffer that the very next
// dispatch consumes and nothing else ever reads.
//
// The sigmoid is computed in float from a bf16 logit. That matters at the
// tails: bf16 has eight mantissa bits, so rounding the logit BEFORE the
// nonlinearity moves the gate by up to a few parts in a thousand, on a term
// that is added to every token's residual in every routed layer.
/// The prefill's shape of the same fused line: rows a uniform `row_pitch`
/// apart, so the whole prompt runs as one dispatch instead of one per token.
///
/// The GATE strides too, and that is the part worth stating. It is ONE number
/// per row, so reading it at `row` rather than `row * row_pitch` looks right
/// and gives every token row 0's gate -- a plausible answer and the wrong one.
/// It strides because `qmv_out_size` answers 1 rather than 0 for
/// `LlSharedGateProj`, which puts it on the projection arm of the prefill's
/// row-stride binding: its output is written a full pitch apart like every
/// other projection's.
