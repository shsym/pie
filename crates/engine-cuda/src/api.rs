//! `impl Engine for Cuda` — the shell behind the contract.
//!
//! [`Cuda`] wraps a `Shell` that has not happened yet: the device knobs a
//! boot config states, an `Option<Shell>` that `load` fills, and the
//! [`Capabilities`] that load answered. Every verb before a load is a
//! refusal with a sentence. [`LoadRequest`] carries no `ModelContract`, so
//! the contract lookup is a function pointer supplied when the engine is
//! opened, by the party that already links the model catalog. `encode`
//! answers [`Error::Unsupported`]: this shell carries no multimodal encoder.
