//! `Group`: one tensor-parallel deployment behind [`Engine`], made of one
//! [`Cuda`] shell per rank.
//!
//! Traces are SPMD — every rank runs the same plan over its own band of the
//! weights and meets the others in the plan's collectives — so a group is
//! the same verbs, issued to every rank at once. Each verb runs on one scoped
//! thread per rank (a rank's device is bound per thread), which is what lets
//! a fire's collectives complete: rank 0's launch would otherwise wait on a
//! peer that has not been asked yet. Rank 0 answers; the followers' answers
//! are checked for errors and for agreeing on the identities they mint.
//!
//! The runtime sees one engine: one load, one frame numbering, one
//! completion sink (rank 0's; a follower's completions are its own
//! business), one set of channels read from rank 0.
