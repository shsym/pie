//! # The words this tree uses, in the conventional ones
//!
//! * [`Shell`] — a loaded model (the engine instance); [`Boot`] — its

//!   the kv cache; [`Shell::open`] — reset a sequence.
//! * `bucket` — a row-count lattice point a fire's rows round up to, one
//!   captured graph per entry (the cudagraph capture size); `rung`/`ladder` —
//!   the per-class row ceiling inside a body key (`record::Ladder`).
//! * `body` — the captured CUDA graph for one composition; `arming` — the
