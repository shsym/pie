//===-- cuda_fp16.h - the fp16 door, answered from inside the binary -----===//
//
// The eighteen names the migrating tree spells out of NVIDIA's
// `cuda_fp16.h`, written directly against the `f16` and `f16x2` instructions
// so that `#include <cuda_fp16.h>` resolves without a toolkit on the machine.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// NVRTC 13.0 was probed on this L40S with an EMPTY header set over the 31
// external includes of the FlashInfer attention closure -- 28 files, 17,981
// lines, reachable from `attention/{cascade,decode,mask,mla,prefill,scheduler,
// state,variants,default_*_params}.cuh` and `{fastdiv,layout,page,pos_enc,
// utils}.cuh`. **0 of 31 answered.** `cuda_fp16.h` was among them:
// *"catastrophic error: could not open source file 'cuda_fp16.h' (no
// directories in search list)"*. NVRTC before 13.3 bundles none of the device
// headers, and `src/source.rs` states the rule the crate is built on: an
// `#include` resolves against a header set carried in the binary, or it does
// not resolve at all.
//
// Reading the toolkit's copy out of `$CUDA_HOME` at build time was tried and
// rejected -- `.wiki/driver/new-horizon.md` §13.2 -- because it puts a CUDA
// installation back on the BUILD machine, which is the one property this
// crate exists to not need, and it pins the embedded device ABI to whatever
// the build box happened to have. So the header is replaced, not found.
//
// # Why it wears NVIDIA's filename
//
// §13.4 states the rule and this file is the case it was written for: a shim
// is named after a vendor header exactly when its includer is upstream source
// we do not own. NVRTC matches `includeNames[]` against the LITERAL string in
// the directive, so a file carried as `cuda_fp16.h` answers FlashInfer's
// `#include <cuda_fp16.h>` with FlashInfer left byte-identical to upstream --
// the resolution becomes ours without the source becoming ours. The sibling
// `pie_half2.cuh` is the other half of the same rule: its includers are six
// of our own `.cu` files, which can say any name, so it says an honest one.
// Impersonation is a name collision held in reserve and spent only here.
//
// # What replacing it costs, measured
//
// Every name was counted twice, comments stripped: once over the 28-file
// closure above, once over the 84 `.cu`/`.cuh` files of
// `kernels-cuda/csrc/src` -- the ahead-of-time archive crate's tree, deleted
// at `85c6c674b`, which is what every `kernels-cuda/` path in this file names
// and never this crate's own `csrc/`. `closure / ours`:

// Four `cvt` spellings, four arithmetic instructions, two bit-casts, a
// shuffle and a pair constructor. Everything else in the vendor's four
// thousand lines -- the `__half` class and its full operator set, the host
// software emulation, the `__half_raw` layer, the two hundred functions
// nothing here calls -- is not the part the kernels need.
//
// The bare `half` spelling is FlashInfer's; our tree writes `__half`. The 133
// bare hits in `kernels-cuda/csrc/src` are a LOCAL VARIABLE (`const int half
// = rope_dim / 2;` in `dsa_indexer.cu`, `mla_paged.cu`, `dequant_fp4.cu`),
// which shadows the alias inside those functions. That is legal, it is
// harmless -- those functions never name the type -- and it is recorded here
// so a reader who greps does not double-count it as a use.
//
// # Two operators are needed, and they were compiled for, not grepped
//
// An operator does not appear in a grep of the call sites. The way to count
// them is to compile with the vendor's own kill switches, so the compiler
// enumerates them: every FlashInfer TU in the AOT build was rebuilt with
// `-D__CUDA_NO_HALF_OPERATORS__`, `-D__CUDA_NO_HALF2_OPERATORS__` and
// `-D__CUDA_NO_HALF_CONVERSIONS__` in turn, one macro at a time, under
// `-Xcudafe --error_limit=300`. The whole answer:
//
//   operator*(half, half)      operator*(half2, half2)
//   operator-(half, half)      operator-(half2, half2)
//   (float) on a half          -- see the divergence below
//
// The same six macros over our own 13 migrating `.cu` files produced ZERO
// errors: our tree uses no fp16 operators and no implicit conversions at all.
//
// # `__half` is the PRELUDE's f16; `__half2` is a pair of them
//
// `pie_device.cuh` already defines `pie::f16`, a struct wrapping an
// `unsigned short`, and says why it is a struct and not a typedef: as typedefs `f16` and `bf16` would be ONE type and a table row
// that swapped them would typecheck. A second fp16 declared here would undo
// that -- `f16*` and a shim's own `__half*` are a pointer conversion
// C++ refuses, at exactly the boundary where a dequant kernel hands its
// output to something written against the prelude. So this file declares no
// fp16. It makes `__half` a NAME for the prelude's, the way `pie_mma.cuh`
// makes `__nv_bfloat16` a name for `pie::bf16` and for the same reason, and a
// duplicate identical typedef is legal so both files may say it.
//
// That is why the prelude is included, and it is the only include here. A
// header in the set that drags in a diamond its includer did not ask for is
// the hazard the set's rule exists to avoid, so the cost is worth naming:
// `<cuda_fp16.h>` now transitively defines `pie::` for FlashInfer. It is
// bounded -- `pie_device.cuh` is `#pragma once`, includes nothing itself, and
// declares only inside `pie` plus the two aliases the shims add at global
// scope -- and it is unavoidable while the
// one true fp16 lives there. The alternative, a private copy of the type,
// is the pointer conversion above.
//
// `__half2` is genuinely new. The prelude has `bf16x2` and stops, because
// every kernel migrated so far widens to fp32, computes, and narrows. These
// call sites do not: FlashInfer's softmax keeps `m` and `d` in `half2`, and
// `dequant_wna16.cu` keeps its whole inner loop in f16x2 so one instruction
// is two MACs. `x` is the LOW half of the 32-bit register and `y` the high,
// field for field with NVIDIA's struct, because both trees `reinterpret_cast`
// a `uint32_t` they assembled themselves onto it. Reversed, it would swap
// every pair -- a wrong answer, not a compile error.
//
// # The divergence that was known, and is now closed
//
// `float(x)` on a `__half` needs a MEMBER conversion operator, and a member
// cannot be added to a type this header does not own. Three sites in the
// closure use one, measured by the `__CUDA_NO_HALF_CONVERSIONS__` build
// above: `vec_dtypes.cuh:159` (`(float)src[0]` in `vec_cast<float, half>`),
// `vec_dtypes.cuh:553` (the same for `nv_bfloat16`) and
// `prefill.cuh:1523` (`float(m_prev[j] * sm_scale.x - ...)`).
//
// Declaring our own `__half` class with the operator would have fixed two of
// the three and cost the type identity above -- and would NOT have fixed the
// third, because `__nv_bfloat16` is pinned to `bf16` by `pie_mma.cuh`
// already. So this file did not try. It recorded the divergence instead, and
// said where the fix belonged: `pie_device.cuh`, where the type is defined,
// one `__device__ operator float() const` on each struct closing all three at
// once. The measurement that made the case was run in memory rather than
// claimed -- all 28 closure files compiled, but
// `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel` refused to INSTANTIATE with one error
// and one only, `vec_dtypes.cuh(159): no suitable conversion function from
// "const half" to "float" exists`; injecting the two members produced a cubin.
//
// That patch has since landed. `pie_device.cuh:88` and `:96` now declare
// `explicit __device__ operator float() const` on `f16` and on `bf16`, and
// `explicit` is the right call -- all three call sites are explicit casts, so
// the conversion they need is reachable while the implicit narrowing that
// would make `h + 1.0f` silently compile is not. Re-measured against the
// carried set with no include path on disk: 28 of 28 closure files accepted,
// and `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel<half>` instantiates into a
// 59,184-byte sm_89 cubin.
//
// `examples/halftype_parity.rs` compiled `(float)h` under NVRTC on every run
// and printed the result, because a divergence that closed once can open
// again -- the probe reported which of the two states it found rather than
// asserting the good one.
//
// # This is not NVIDIA's header
//
// `cuda_fp16.hpp` on this machine was READ, to check the answer -- which
// rounding mode each `cvt` carries, which operand of `cvt.rn.f16x2.f32`
// lands in the high half, that the vendor gates the packed converts at sm_80
// -- and nothing was copied out of it. That is deliberate: copying vendor
// header text into this repository is a REDISTRIBUTION with a `NOTICE` entry
// behind it, and avoiding exactly that is why these headers are being
// replaced instead of vendored. A shim that got here by copy-paste would
// have made the whole exercise pointless. The semantics below come from the
// PTX ISA -- §9.7.4 *Half Precision Floating Point Instructions* and §9.7.9
// `cvt` -- which is a specification and not an implementation.
//
// # Architecture, and why the fallbacks are exact
//
// The instructions used here are not all available everywhere, and the ISA's
// own Target ISA Notes decide the gates: `mul/sub/fma.f16{x2}` require sm_53;
// `max.f16{x2}` requires sm_80; a `.f16x2` DESTINATION for `cvt` requires
// sm_80. The crate targets sm_89 today, but a shim that silently miscompiles
// on sm_75 is worse than one that refuses, so every gated site has a fallback
// written out below it.
//
// The fallbacks are not approximations, but one of them had to be rewritten
// to earn that. A product of two fp16 values has at most 2p = 22 bits and is
// EXACT in fp32, so a fallback that multiplies in fp32 and narrows once
// rounds once -- Figueroa's condition on innocuous double rounding wants an
// intermediate of at least 2p + 2 bits and fp32's 24 meets it for p = 11.
// That argument does NOT extend to `a * b + c`, and `halftype_parity` found
// the counterexample rather than the reasoning: an exact fp16 fused
// multiply-add can need 84 significant bits, and on `a = 0x19ff`,
// `b = 0x1a01`, `c = 0x1a03` the fp32 intermediate lands exactly on an fp16
// midpoint that the exact result sits just below, so the second rounding goes
// the wrong way. `__hfma2`'s fallback therefore recovers the fp32 add's error
// with a 2Sum and rounds the intermediate to ODD, which is innocuous for any
// target two or more bits narrower. fp16's whole subnormal range is normal in
// fp32, so nothing underflows on the way through. None of this is left as an
// argument: define `PIE_HALFTYPE_FORCE_PORTABLE` and every gate below takes
// its fallback, which is how `halftype_parity` ran the sm_75 path on an
// sm_89 device and compares it against the same nvcc reference -- and it is
// how the `__hfma2` defect above was a red row in a table rather than a wrong
// attention score on a Turing card.
//
// # The check that made this trustworthy, and where it went
//
// A conversion that rounds the wrong way still compiles, so compiling proves
// nothing and a tolerance would hide exactly the defect worth catching.
// `examples/halftype_parity.rs` was the gate: it ran each function below
// under NVRTC against these headers and the SAME function under `nvcc`
// against the real `<cuda_fp16.h>`, on the same inputs on the same device,
// and compared BIT PATTERNS. It swept all 65,536 fp16 patterns, all 65,536
// bf16 patterns and all 65,536 bf16 TIES, every fp16 tie and its two fp32
// neighbours, 1.2e6 pseudo-random floats plus every special (+-0, +-inf,
// quiet and signalling NaN, largest finite, smallest normal, subnormals on
// both sides), and a 216x216 exponent grid for the packed ops. As of its last
// run: 43 functions, 39,847,842 comparisons, zero differing bits, and the
// same again with every fallback forced on. It then corrupted one kernel --
// the two source operands of `cvt.rn.f16x2.f32`, swapped -- and required the
// comparison to CATCH it, because a green table proves nothing unless a red
// one was reachable.
//
// **That probe is gone**, deleted with the whole of `kernels-cuda/examples/`,
// which is why every mention of `halftype_parity` below is in the past tense
// and names a measurement rather than a file. The measurement is still the
// standard this file is held to -- bit patterns, both compilers, one device,
// no tolerance, and a deliberate corruption that has to be caught -- so a
// function added or changed below needs that comparison rebuilt before anyone
// can call it checked. What still runs is `tests/prelude_parity.rs`, and it
// answers a different question: whether one `#include` of an honest name
// yields a working environment, not whether the arithmetic rounds the way
// NVIDIA's does.

// `__half_raw` is the vendor's way to get at the bits without going through a
// constructor, and this file's first version left it out on the strength of a
// census: zero uses in the FlashInfer closure, zero in
// `kernels-cuda/csrc/src`. The census was right and the conclusion was wrong,
// because the CONSUMER IS NOT IN EITHER TREE. `csrc/shim/cuda_fp8.h` -- a
// sibling shim in the same header set -- returns `__half_raw` from
// `__nv_cvt_fp8_to_halfraw` and takes `static_cast<__half_raw>(f).x` in both
// fp8 class constructors. No grep of the two SOURCE trees could see it.
//
// It failed silently, which is the part worth recording. `cuda_fp8.h` guards
// its half interop on `__CUDA_FP16_TYPES_EXIST__` -- correctly, mirroring
// what NVIDIA's headers do, so that a TU which includes it alone gets a name
// error rather than a mystery. This file did not define that macro, so the
// guard was false, so the entire fp8-to-half interop COMPILED OUT and the
// only symptom was `identifier "__nv_cvt_fp8_to_halfraw" is undefined` at a
// call site, 9 of which live in `kernels-cuda/csrc/src`. A header set is
// composed, not merely collected, and composition has to be compiled rather
// than inferred.
//
// The layout is the vendor's, because that is the whole point of the type:
// `__align__(2)` with one `unsigned short x` for the scalar, `__align__(4)`
// with `x` and `y` for the pair.
//
// The CONVERSIONS sit here rather than on `__half`, and that is a real
// difference from NVIDIA worth stating. The vendor puts `__half(__half_raw)`
// and `operator __half_raw()` on its `__half` class; ours is
// `bf16`'s neighbour `f16`, a plain aggregate defined in a
// crate this file may not edit, so a member cannot be added to it. Putting
// both directions on the raw struct instead makes `static_cast<__half_raw>(h)`
// and `static_cast<__half>(raw)` mean exactly what they mean with the real
// header. Neither is `explicit`: `tests/prelude_parity.rs` writes
// `__half back = __half_raw(...)`, which is COPY-initialisation, and
// copy-initialisation does not consider explicit conversion functions.
//
// Both keep a defaulted default constructor, because `cuda_fp8.h:293` writes
// `__half_raw res; res.x = ...;`. Nothing in either tree aggregate-initialises
// one, which is the only thing a user-provided constructor would have cost.
