///     launches: measured 67 tok/s against 747 for the routed dequant path it
///     would replace.
///
/// Two call sites must agree on this or a model fails to load with a message
/// about the target's capabilities: `context.cpp` publishes it as the
/// `native_mxfp4_moe` device fact the loader plans against, and
/// `loaded_model.cpp` passes the same bit into `DeviceTarget`. They disagreed
/// once already, and the symptom was a checkpoint that quietly took the slow
/// path with the fast kernels compiled in and unused.

// routed GEMV 2x AHEAD at one row, level around six, and 2.6x behind by
// thirty-two. A throughput fleet wants Marlin; a latency-bound single stream
// wants the GEMV, and on Hopper the difference end to end is 253 tok/s against

// The Marlin MXFP4 MoE kernels produce WRONG VALUES on sm_100.
//
// Measured on a B200 with gpt-oss-20b: under this lowering decode emits
// uniform garbage ("nasquorashBR @@ Put ShortfacesInte Imper fmt Ind tass"),
// a 0% function-word rate against 39% for the same prompt on vLLM and
// SGLang. Under the routed-dequant GEMV the same build answers correctly at
// 314 tok/s. Bisected against CUDA graph capture: corrupt both captured and
// eager, correct both ways with the GEMV, so the lowering is the only
// variable. The generated kernel set is sm80-shaped
// (`sm80_kernel_bfloat16_fe2m1f_bfloat16.cu`) and was never exercised above
// sm_90.
//
// This is quarantined rather than left to the deployment to discover because
// the gate above answers TRUE on Blackwell whether or not Marlin was built --
// so without this, every sm_100 deployment serves gpt-oss as garbage BY
// DEFAULT, and the failure is silent: the tokens arrive, at a plausible rate,
// and only reading them reveals it.
//
// UPDATE: the root cause is found, and it is NOT the kernel. Two bugs in the
// lowering ABOVE the GEMM, both architecture-independent, so they were
// corrupting sm_80 exactly as described here for sm_100:
//
//   1. the MXFP4 group scales were transposed twice -- the loader already
//      publishes them in Marlin's order and `mixtral.cpp` transposed them
//      again. Mean relative error against a host reference, measured with
//      `bench/marlin_moe_verify.cu` at gpt-oss's shape: 0.0017 correct,
//      0.9350 double-transposed, i.e. uncorrelated output.
//   2. `d_marlin_act`'s padding tail was never initialised, and `0 * NaN` is
//      NaN, so one NaN pattern poisoned a whole fp32-accumulated output row.
//
// The Marlin MoE kernel and the weight repack are themselves correct on
// sm_80 (0.0017-0.0023 mean rel err across E in {1,4,32}, top_k in {1,4}).
// After both fixes sm_80 measures 0/64 degenerate requests at 32-wide and
// 0/16 at concurrency 1, against 8-12/32 and 2/16 before.
//
// This quarantine is therefore very likely stale: the B200 garbage described
// above has the same signature and the same two causes. It is left in place
// only because there is no Blackwell here to verify on. RE-TEST sm_100 with
// `PIE_CUDA_NATIVE_MXFP4_MOE=1` and drop this if it is clean.
