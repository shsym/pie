//! The handle vocabulary: runtime-typed, `Copy`, and never dereferenced.
//!
//! The old plane spoke `Tensor<T>` — a device pointer behind a phantom
//! scalar, with rows/width riding on the `In`/`Out`/`InOut` marks around it.
//! Here the type parameter is erased into a [`Dtype`] field and the marks'
//! extents fold onto the handle itself; nothing else is added. The old
//! handle carried no stride or offset (its regions were always dense,
//! `stride == width`), so none are carried here either.
//!
//! One rule, stated once: **`&`/`&mut` is intent, not borrow discipline.**
//! A handle names GPU memory the host never dereferences, so the borrow
//! checker cannot enforce anything about the bytes behind it — an entry
//! takes its outputs as `&mut Tensor` to *say* what it writes, and that
//! signature is the whole record of write intent (design §5).
