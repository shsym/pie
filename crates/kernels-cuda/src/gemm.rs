    //
    // A collective is a launch like any other, with two things in its
    // row that no other row here says.
    //
    // `whole`, for a reason stronger than XQA's: every rank must enter
    // the same collective the same number of times, so a row window
    // that split one rank's launch and not another's would deadlock
    // rather than compute the wrong answer. The refusal is not an
    // optimisation.
    //
    // And they are SYNCHRONISATION points. The graph-capture rules have
    // to know that, which is why they are stated rather than reached
    // for through `tp->` from inside a hand-written pass.
    // THE THREE NCCL COLLECTIVES ARE UNSTATED, and not for want of a
    // signature: they are METHODS on `NcclComm`, which lives in the
    // DRIVER, and `kernels-cuda` neither includes `nccl.h` nor links
    // NCCL. A free wrapper here would have to either take a driver type
    // this crate cannot see, or reimplement the dispatch each method
    // does -- the custom-all-reduce fast path, the watchdog count, the
    // async NCCL error check -- which is a second implementation, not a
    // wrapper.
    //
    // The fused landing below was the OTHER kind and went in: its method
    // is on `kernels::comm::CustomAllReduce`, a kernels-side class, so a
    // free form taking the instance needed nothing this crate lacks.
    //
    // What would close these is a layer decision rather than a
    // signature: either `kernels-cuda` gains an NCCL dependency and the
    // collectives move down, or the symbols admit they name DRIVER
    // operations and the ABI grows a second namespace root. Both are
    // real answers; neither is this file's to pick.
