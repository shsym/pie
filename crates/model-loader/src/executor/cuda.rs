//! The arena on a discrete CUDA device, and the transforms that run there.
//!
//! [`super::arena`] made the arena a BACKING so the executor would not have to
//! know whether its bytes were reachable by the host. That left one thing
//! undone: the backing still decided which KERNEL a transform ran, and the
//! only implementation of it lived in a driver. So "the loader loads" was true
//! of every decision except the ones that need a GPU, and a second consumer
//! wanting a device load had to write this file again.
//!
//! It lives here now, behind `feature = "cuda"`. The crate without that
//! feature is what it always was — `half`, `ztensor`, `serde` — and
//! `pie model convert` on a machine with no toolkit builds it unchanged. The
//! feature is the only `#[cfg]` this adds: [`ArenaBacking`] was already the
//! seam, so nothing in `executor/walk.rs` learns that a GPU exists.
//!
//! # What the caller still owns, and why
//!
//! The device ALLOCATION. [`CudaArena::new`] takes a pointer and a length,
//! not an allocator, because a consumer that has a pool, a VMM reservation or
//! a suballocated slab must be able to hand a span of it over — and because
//! "hand the loader an arena" is the whole shape this is for. What the loader
//! owns is everything between that pointer and the finished weights: the
//! staging, the transfers, the transforms.
//!
//! # Two things this does beyond addressing
//!
//! **The staging buffer is PINNED.** `cudaMemcpyAsync` out of pageable memory
//! is asynchronous in name only — the runtime stages it internally and the
//! call blocks — which made every byte of a load cross at roughly half the
//! achievable rate with no overlap at all. The executor hands over a borrowed
//! `&[u8]` it reuses, so the bytes have to be copied somewhere before the copy
//! can be left in flight; copying them into pinned memory is that somewhere.
//!
//! Two slots, alternated: one can be in flight while the executor fills the
//! next. A write larger than a slot bypasses staging and goes synchronously,
//! because a 39 GB checkpoint must not be able to make this allocate
//! proportionally to a tensor.
//!
//! **`Cast`, `Scale` and `Encode` run HERE**, on the device, when both
//! operands are already in the arena. The host path for those is a device read
//! that synchronizes, an arithmetic loop, and a device write — a full round
//! trip to compute something `kernels-cuda` has a kernel for.
