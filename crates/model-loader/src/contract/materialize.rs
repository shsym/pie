//! What materializing a checkpoint as pie's own format means.
//!
//! `pie model convert` rewrites any checkpoint as a `.zt` artifact, and this
//! module derives the split that rewrite works from: which tensors *decode* —
//! a blocked scheme the host executor has a decoder for, undone to the logical
//! dtype no device kernel has to unpick — and which pass through byte for
//! byte, keeping their encoding. Quantized tensors without a decoder are in
//! the second set, not an error: `.zt` carries their scheme parametrically, so
//! copying them is exact.
//!
//! Everything here is derived from the checkpoint's own metadata — which
//! tensors exist and how each is encoded — and none of it from a model
//! family. That is what lets it live in the loader at all: the contract it
//! writes names no family convention. It only undoes an *encoding*, tensor by
//! tensor, under each tensor's own name, so the output is a checkpoint with
//! exactly the names and shapes a family contract already knows how to load.
//!
//! The contract covers the decoded set *only*. Passthrough tensors are copied
//! by the caller straight from the source files through a bounded buffer —
//! putting them in the contract would route gigabytes of untouched bytes
//! through the plan executor's memory to say "copy".
