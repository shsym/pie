//! What a launch rule means when the workgroup is not the driver's to choose.
//!
//! `dispatch_workgroups(x, y, z)` takes a count of WORKGROUPS; the size of one
//! is `@workgroup_size(...)` in the WGSL, fixed when the module was written.
//! The Metal shapes in `lowering/grid.rs` remain the reference for the
//! iteration space a kernel must cover, but the answer here is a different kind
//! of number. The arithmetic below is `driver-vulkan`'s, because `vkCmdDispatch`
//! counts the same things and a grid that differed between two shells would
//! mean one of them is wrong.
//!
//! One thing is this API's: [`Ungeometric::PastDeviceLimit`]. WebGPU's
//! `max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension` has a guaranteed floor of **65535**,
//! which a 4096-wide elementwise launch over 32 rows reaches, and `wgpu`
//! answers a dispatch past it by refusing the encode. [`groups_within`] turns
//! that into a sentence instead of a panic at submit.
//!
//! [`groups`] rounds up everywhere, because an undershot grid reports nothing:
//! the lanes never launched write nothing, the gap reads back as whatever the
//! buffer was born with, and the queue returns success. Any test of it must use
//! a shape that does NOT divide evenly — at 512 elements over a 256-wide
//! workgroup, `div_ceil` and plain division are the same expression. The tests
//! below run at 460 and at 13.
//!
//! Each rule takes the `local` size read from the module it is about to
//! dispatch rather than assuming one. `SdpaVector` compiles one module per head
//! dimension, each declaring `@workgroup_size(PIE_HEAD_DIM / 2)`; `Elementwise`
//! is 256 wide in most of its modules and 16x16 in the strided gathers.
//!
//! **That `/ 2` is the one place a launch rule's ARITHMETIC differs from
//! `driver-vulkan`'s**: WGSL has no 16-bit storage type, so every bf16 tensor
//! crosses as `array<u32>` with two values to a word, and a decode-attention
//! lane owns the PAIR because there is no sub-word atomic to make sharing one
//! safe. [`lanes`] halves with it. `sdpa_vector.wgsl` also reads
//! `num_workgroups.x` as its query-head COUNT, so the Vulkan expression would
//! both build a grid twice as wide and tell every lane the model has twice the
//! heads it has.
//!
//! Every `Qmm` entrypoint names its tile IN THE ENTRYPOINT — `..._bm_16_bn_64`
//! — so the tile is a property of the module the driver selected, never
//! inferred from the row count. [`Module::loaded`] checks the agreement against
//! a [`crate::reflect::Declared`], which is `naga` reading the WGSL that will be
//! dispatched, on any machine, with no adapter.
