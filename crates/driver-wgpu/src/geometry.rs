//! What a launch rule means when the workgroup is not the driver's to choose.
//!
//! `driver-metal` answers a [`Rule`] with a thread grid AND a threadgroup,
//! because `dispatchThreads` takes both and Metal sizes the group at dispatch.
//! `dispatch_workgroups` takes neither. It takes a count of WORKGROUPS, and the
//! size of one is `@workgroup_size(...)` in the WGSL — a compile-time attribute
//! fixed when the module was written, not when it was launched.
//!
//! So this module cannot be a port of `lowering/grid.rs`. The Metal shapes are
//! still the reference — they are the ones proved against real checkpoints, and
//! the iteration space a kernel must cover does not change with the API — but
//! the answer here is a different kind of number, and getting from one to the
//! other is where the whole class of porting bug in this tree lives.
//!
//! # This is the file that changed least in the Vulkan port, on purpose
//!
//! `dispatch_workgroups(x, y, z)` counts exactly what `vkCmdDispatch(x, y, z)`
//! counts, so every line of arithmetic below is `driver-vulkan`'s, and the
//! reasons attached to each rounding are its reasons unedited. That is not
//! laziness: a rule is a claim about a KERNEL, the three trees are one tree of
//! kernels, and a grid that differed between two shells would mean one of them
//! is wrong rather than that the APIs differ.
//!
//! One thing is added, and it is the API's: [`Ungeometric::PastDeviceLimit`].
//! Vulkan reports `maxComputeWorkGroupCount` in the millions on every real
//! device and a driver may reasonably never think about it. WebGPU's
//! `max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension` has a guaranteed floor of **65535**,
//! which a 4096-wide elementwise launch over 32 rows reaches, so it is a limit
//! a real fire can hit — and `wgpu` answers a dispatch past it by refusing the
//! encode, which is a panic or a validation error at submit rather than a
//! sentence about the launch. [`groups_within`] is where that sentence is.
//!
//! # Undershoot is the failure that does not report itself
//!
//! An overshot grid is caught by a shader's own tail guard. An UNDERSHOT grid
//! is not caught by anything: the lanes that were never launched write nothing,
//! the gap reads back as whatever the buffer was born with — zeros, from a
//! fresh pool — and the queue returns success. Every kernel in this tree that
//! was wrong after the Vulkan port was wrong this way, and none of them were
//! wrong in the arithmetic.
//!
//! That is why [`groups`] rounds up everywhere, and why any test of it must use
//! a shape that does NOT divide evenly: at 512 elements over a 256-wide
//! workgroup, `div_ceil` and plain division are the same expression and the
//! rounding is unproven. `driver-vulkan` learned that with five tests that all
//! ran at exact multiples and caught nothing; the tests below run at 460 and
//! at 13.
//!
//! # The module's own size is an input
//!
//! Each rule below takes the `local` size read from the module it is about to
//! dispatch, rather than assuming one. Two rules need this and the rest are
//! merely honest about it:
//!
//! * `SdpaVector` compiles one module per head dimension — 64, 128, 256, 512 —
//!   and each declares `@workgroup_size(PIE_HEAD_DIM / 2)`. A geometry that
//!   assumed 256 would launch a quarter of the workgroups for a 64-wide head.
//! * `Elementwise` is 256 wide in most of its modules and 16x16 in the strided
//!   gathers, which are laid out per (channel, row).
//!
//! **That `/ 2` is the one place a launch rule's ARITHMETIC differs from
//! `driver-vulkan`'s**, and it is forced rather than chosen. WGSL has no 16-bit
//! storage type, so every bf16 tensor crosses as `array<u32>` with two values
//! to a word — and a lane that owned one channel would read-modify-write a word
//! its neighbour writes at the same instant, which WGSL has no sub-word atomic
//! to make safe. So a decode-attention lane owns the PAIR, the workgroup is
//! half as wide as the head, and [`lanes`] halves with it. Getting it wrong is
//! not an undershoot to be caught by a tail guard: `sdpa_vector.wgsl` reads
//! `num_workgroups.x` as its query-head COUNT, so the Vulkan expression would
//! build a grid twice as wide AND tell every lane the model has twice the heads
//! it has.
//!
//! The GEMM tile is the same kind of fact and was nearly missed in the Vulkan
//! port. Every `Qmm` entrypoint names its tile IN THE ENTRYPOINT —
//! `..._bm_16_bn_64` — so the tile a module was compiled for is a property of
//! the module the driver selected, not something to be inferred from the row
//! count. Inferring it is what the first draft of that file did, and picking
//! the widest tile that divides 64 rows while dispatching a module written at
//! `bm_16` launches a quarter of the workgroups needed. That undershoot writes
//! three quarters of nothing and returns success.
//!
//! Reading these from the module is also the only way the agreement can be
//! CHECKED, and here that check costs nothing at all: [`Module::loaded`] takes
//! a [`crate::reflect::Declared`], which is `naga` reading the WGSL that will
//! be dispatched, on any machine, with no adapter.
