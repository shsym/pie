//! One launch of a plan, turned into the four things a dispatch needs.
//!
//! [`binding`](crate::binding) answers where an operand lives, and
//! [`geometry`](crate::geometry) answers how many workgroups a rule wants.
//! Neither knows about the other, and a plan states neither directly: it states
//! a rectangle, a symbol, and a run of operands. This file is the join. It
//! turns one [`Launch`] into a [`Dispatch`] — a module name, its bound
//! operands, its parameter bytes, and its grid — and nothing here needs a
//! device, so the whole join can be measured against real plans on a machine
//! with no adapter in it.
//!
//! # Why the grid needs the statement and not just the fire
//!
//! A [`Rule`] evaluates against [`Dims`], and most of `Dims` is fire-wide: head
//! count, head width, expert count. Most, not all. `KernelSig` carries three
//! indices — `grid_param`, `head_param`, `heads_param` — that each name a
//! scalar in the STATEMENT's own run, and a row that names one is saying its
//! extent varies per layer in a way no fire-wide number can express.
//!
//! Gemma-4 is the case that forces it: its full-attention layers rotate a
//! quarter of each head and its sliding layers rotate all of one, and they
//! carry four 512-wide KV heads against sixteen 256-wide ones. A driver reading
//! the fire's `rotary_dims` describes neither. `driver-metal` learned this and
//! states so at [`dims_of`]'s counterpart; the reading is transcribed rather
//! than rediscovered.
//!
//! A row naming a param its statement does not carry falls back to the fire
//! rather than to zero, because a grid of zero is a dispatch that runs nothing,
//! returns success, and leaves the output holding whatever it was born with.
//! That failure mode is the one this crate refuses hardest —
//! [`Undispatchable::Empty`] is where.
//!
//! # The device limit is deliberately not applied here
//!
//! [`plan_one`] calls [`crate::geometry::groups`] and not `groups_within`,
//! because a `Dispatch` is what the KERNEL needs and the limit is a property of
//! the adapter that will run it. The device half checks
//! [`Dispatch::groups`] against its own
//! `max_compute_workgroups_per_dimension` at encode time, where it has the
//! number. Folding the limit in here would mean a plan that this build can
//! reason about only where it can also run.

    // Every binding the SHADER READS has to be filled, and this is the count
    // form of that claim. It is an INEQUALITY, and the direction is the whole
    // content of the line.
    //
    // `driver-vulkan` asserts equality here -- `buffers + block == bindings -
    // holes` -- and that equality is a Vulkan coincidence, not a rule. There a
    // "hole" is a binding number with NO declaration, because `glslc` deletes
    // the declaration of a buffer a variant never reads; the descriptor set
    // still needs a slot at every number up to the highest, the plan has
    // nothing to put in it, and the row says `Unbound` at exactly those
    // positions. So `Nothing`-slots and holes are the same slots, and equality
    // holds.
    //
    // `naga` deletes nothing. A hole here means DECLARED AND NOT READ BY THIS
    // ENTRY POINT, which is a different fact: the binding exists, the row names
    // a real tensor for it, and the driver binds one. Measured over the
    // complete tree, 19 entrypoints have such a slot -- `kv_append_paged` keeps
    // six ring-ABI placeholders, and every `sdpa_paged_*` declares an
    // attention-sink buffer its non-sink variants do not read -- and 13 of them
    // belong to rows that state operands. Carrying the equality across refused
    // all thirteen, including every `sdpa_paged_decode` and `router_topk`: the
    // paged decode step and every mixture layer, which is to say most of what a
    // model runs.
    //
    // So the check that survives is the useful half. A dispatch may bind MORE
    // than the shader reads -- that is a layout entry the body ignores, and it
    // costs a descriptor. It may not bind FEWER, because an entry the shader
    // reads and the group does not carry is a `wgpu` validation failure at
    // encode time, with a number in the message and no launch.
    //
    // Dormant today, and stated rather than deleted for that reason: it can
    // only fire when a slot comes back `Nothing`, and no row in this table
    // states `Source::Unbound`. `descriptors` refuses the same thing per slot
    // and by NAME (`Unlayoutable::Unfilled`), which is the better message; this
    // is the arithmetic backstop for a row that grows a gap.
