//! What a WGSL module says about itself.
//!
//! A driver holds the source anyway — `kernels_wgpu::entrypoint_source` hands
//! it the expanded text — and several of the numbers it needs to dispatch one
//! are inside that text rather than in any table: the workgroup size, the
//! bindings a bind-group layout must cover, and, for deciding whether a grid
//! may be rounded, whether the shader reads its own workgroup count.
//!
//! Reading them here rather than restating them in `kernels-wgpu`'s table is
//! not a preference. A table entry can drift from the shader it describes; a
//! value read out of the module cannot.
//!
//! # Nothing is hand-parsed, and that is the whole difference from `spirv.rs`
//!
//! `driver-vulkan/src/spirv.rs` is 993 lines of word-stream walking: opcode
//! constants, a type graph, a size recursion, a bound on how deep it will
//! follow a pointer so that a corrupt file cannot hang the driver. It has to
//! be, because SPIR-V arrives as bytes from a build directory and nothing in
//! the Rust ecosystem was going to read them for it.
//!
//! WGSL arrives as TEXT and `naga` is a WGSL front end written in Rust, so
//! this module is a walk over `naga::Module` and there is no parser here at
//! all. `naga` is depended on DIRECTLY rather than through `wgpu`'s re-export,
//! for the reason `Cargo.toml` gives: every question below is about the
//! source, so it belongs in the portable half, and that half must not need an
//! adapter to answer.
//!
//! # Which of `spirv.rs`'s answers survive, and which have no analog
//!
//! This is the part worth reading, because three of the seven do not transfer
//! and each one fails to transfer for a different reason.
//!
//! **`local` survives, and is easier.** `@workgroup_size(16, 16)` is
//! `EntryPoint::workgroup_size`, already normalised to three axes. WGSL also
//! allows an `override` to size a workgroup, which `naga` keeps separately as
//! `workgroup_size_overrides`; no shader in this tree uses one, and
//! [`Unreadable::OverriddenWorkgroup`] refuses rather than reporting the
//! default a pipeline may not end up with.
//!
//! **`bindings` survives, and means something narrower.** It counts
//! `@group(0)` only, because `kernels-wgpu`'s ABI puts every buffer operand in
//! group 0 and the one uniform block in group 1. Vulkan has a single binding
//! numbering shared by both kinds; WebGPU has a bind group per number, so
//! "highest binding plus one" is a question you have to ask of a GROUP.
//!
//! **`used` survives, and is still worth having.** `naga` keeps a
//! `GlobalVariable` the entry point never reads, exactly as `glslc` keeps a
//! `binding` decoration for a buffer a variant never touches. The consequence
//! differs: Vulkan needs a descriptor at every number up to the highest and a
//! driver has to find something to put in a hole, while `wgpu` requires the
//! bind group to MATCH its layout — and the layout is derived from this same
//! reading, so a declared-and-unread binding is a slot the shell must still
//! fill with something. Same question, same answer, different consequence for
//! getting it wrong.
//!
//! **`push_offsets` becomes [`Declared::uniform_offsets`], and the check it
//! feeds points the OTHER WAY.** `kernels-vulkan`'s `layout-10069` finding is
//! that a push block DECLARED wider than the pipeline's range is a validation
//! error: Vulkan checks the shader against the layout and complains when the
//! shader over-declares. WebGPU has no such rule, because a uniform binding is
//! a buffer: WGSL requires the BOUND range to be at least the struct's size,
//! and `wgpu` refuses a binding that is too small. So the direction of the
//! check inverts — there the module must not ask for more than the layout
//! promised, here the shell must not offer less than the module's struct
//! needs. [`Declared::uniform_bytes`] is what a shell compares its block
//! against, and being OVER is fine.
//!
//! **`reads_workgroup_count` survives unchanged.** `@builtin(num_workgroups)`
//! is a WGSL builtin and means what `gl_NumWorkGroups` means, so the rounding
//! argument in [`crate::geometry::groups`] transfers word for word.
//!
//! **`grid_axes` survives but is WEAKER, and the weakness is structural.** In
//! SPIR-V, `gl_GlobalInvocationID` is a global variable and every read of a
//! component is an `OpAccessChain` or an `OpCompositeExtract` in the entry
//! point's own instruction stream. In WGSL the builtin is a function
//! ARGUMENT, and this tree's bodies pass the whole `vec3<u32>` to a helper —
//! `norm/rms.wgsl` calls `row_base(wg)` — so the component that is really read
//! is indexed against the CALLEE's parameter. This walk follows calls to
//! recover it (see [`Declared::grid_axes`]), with a depth bound, and where it
//! cannot follow it answers "every axis" rather than "no axis", because the
//! unknown answer must not let a wrong grid pass a check. Where it CAN follow
//! it is exact, and the pair in
//! `tests::two_entrypoints_of_one_file_are_told_apart_by_the_axis_they_read`
//! is the measurement: two bodies of one file, one `//#if` apart, differing in
//! exactly the axis they read.
//!
//! **`block_bytes` survives for the same reason it existed.** A parameter
//! struct in a storage buffer is what `rms_single_row`'s `params: Buf` operand
//! binds, and a buffer shorter than the struct the shader reads is a defect
//! with no symptom on this backend too: WGSL's bounds checking means an
//! out-of-range read returns zero rather than faulting, so a missing field is
//! a plausible number and not a crash.
//!
//! **`Malformed` mostly does not survive.** Truncation, a wrong magic word, a
//! zero-length instruction: all three are byte-level conditions of a binary
//! format, and this module is handed a `&str`. What is left is
//! [`Unreadable`], which is `naga`'s own parse error plus the two structural
//! conditions a table can disagree with a shader about.
//!
//! # Nothing here is cached
//!
//! Parsing a module is a few hundred microseconds and a caller does it once
//! per distinct kernel at model load, because what a caller actually caches is
//! the PIPELINE. A cache in this module would be a second lifetime to reason
//! about for a saving nobody measured.
