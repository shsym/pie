//! One baker fire: the walk, and where every value it touches lives.
//!
//! # `walk.rs`, where cuda's sibling is `fire.rs`
//!
//! The ONE spelling that diverges from `driver-cuda/src/baker/`, and it
//! diverges because `driver-metal` already has a room called `fire` -- the
//! device-half one that holds a fire's scratch leases, its recorded command
//! buffers and its commit path. That crate's `tests/portable_half.rs` keeps the
//! two halves apart by matching PATH SEGMENTS, so a portable module importing
//! `super::fire` reads as the portable half naming the Apple-only half, which
//! is exactly the class of mistake that audit exists to catch. `driver-wgpu`
//! took the same spelling to keep the two shader planes readable side by side,
//! and it is the one this crate keeps.
//!
//! `driver-cuda/src/baker/fire.rs` is the reference; what differs is the
//! payload and nothing else. Cuda's arena is a `*mut c_void` and its rectangles
//! are pointer arithmetic; metal's is an address and an extent; wgpu's is a
//! region that names its BUFFER, because a `wgpu::BufferBinding` is an object
//! and two offsets and there is no address space to do arithmetic in. Here it
//! is [`Plane::Slice`], and the only two things this file asks of one are
//! [`Plane::span`] and [`Plane::extent`].
//!
//! # The walk runs on any host, and that is the design
//!
//! Nothing in this file names a device type, and now nothing in it names a
//! PLANE either. The steps come off a `model_compiler::program::Program`, the
//! rectangles off its `slots`, the pools off a [`Fires::Pools`] the caller
//! supplies as plain regions, and each step goes through [`Fires::dispatch`]
//! with a `ctx` that is `dyn Encode` on both shader planes. What a device does
//! is behind that `dyn`, so the whole walk -- its order, the points it asks
//! for, the handles it binds -- is checkable with no GPU and no adapter in the
//! process, which is what each driver's `tests/the_walk_is_the_program.rs`
//! does.
//!
//! # The arena is value-major, exactly as cuda's is
//!
//! The marks a kernel is handed carry `{handle, rows, width}` and NO STRIDE, so
//! every kernel reads row `r` at element `r * width` of its binding. A value's
//! rows must therefore be CONTIGUOUS, which is what value-major gives them:
//! value `V` owns `[offset_V * rows, offset_V * rows + bytes_V * rows)` and its
//! rows are `width` apart inside it. A ROW-MAJOR READING would put `row_pitch`
//! between them and agrees with this one only at `rows == 1`.

/// A device-to-device copy this fire needs before a kernel writes through an

/// walk has none. `model_compiler::program` mints a FRESH rectangle for every
/// result, including the results of points whose declaration marks an operand
/// `InOut` (`norm.residual_add`, `rope.partial`, `gate.sigmoid_mul`); the
/// kernel writes through the handle it is handed, so the operand's bytes have
/// to be in the result's region before it fires.
///
/// WHAT A DEVICE HALF DOES WITH ONE IS ITS OWN, and the three answers are the
/// reason this is a record rather than a call. Cuda issues a
/// `cudaMemcpyAsync` on the spot. Metal stages a host `memcpy`, which it can
/// because every allocation is `StorageModeShared`. wgpu can do neither -- a
/// `wgpu::Buffer` is not host-mapped mid-frame -- so it encodes a
/// `copy_buffer_to_buffer` in walk order. All three read the same `{from, to,
/// bytes, op}`, and [`Blit::op`] is what puts it ahead of the right dispatch.
///
/// THE ARENA'S REUSE IS WHAT MAKES THE COPY SAFE, not what threatens it. The
/// walk's spans are inclusive at the step that runs, so an operand read at step
/// `s` and a result written at step `s` are live together and can never be
/// given the same bytes: `from` and `to` are always disjoint. Aliasing them
