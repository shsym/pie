//! THE METAL LAUNCHER SURFACE — and, in practice, the surface THREE
//! backends execute.
//!
//! The METAL launchers a lowered declaration may state — the `cuda`
//! of the second backend (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` ②).
//!
//! # Who states this, and who runs it
//!
//! `model::shared::llama_like::forward::llama_like_metal` is the only text
//! written against it, and its plans are executed by `driver-metal`,
//! `driver-vulkan` AND `driver-wgpu` — the latter two have kernel tables
//! (`kernels_vulkan::KERNELS`, `kernels_wgpu::KERNELS`) that are
//! `kernels-metal`'s coverage row for row, so a plan naming these symbols
//! resolves in any of the three. That is why there is no `dsl::vulkan` and
//! no `dsl::wgpu`: a second copy of these 32 statements would be 32 more
//! places for the same symbol to be spelled differently, and the tables are
//! pinned equal precisely so that it never has to be.
//!
//! UNVERIFIED ON METAL (2026-08-05). Every symbol here is an MSL entrypoint
//! read off the driver's source (`crates/driver-metal/csrc/src/batch/decode_psos.cpp`'s
//! `PsoSpec` table and `model/qwen3_5/decode_step.hpp`'s `Kernel` kinds),
//! not something a running METAL deployment produced: the Metal driver
//! cannot build on the machine we have, because `xcrun --find metal` fails —
//! the shader compiler ships with full Xcode.
//! `.wiki/tart/macos.md` rung 3 is where that gets proven, by showing
//! `declared_dag.hpp`'s emitted descriptors come out unchanged.
//!
//! It is NOT unexercised, though, and the sentence here used to say
//! "nothing consumes this yet" — which stopped being true when the WebGPU
//! shell landed. `driver-wgpu`'s `checkpoint`, `serving` and `arena` suites
//! and `driver-vulkan`'s `checkpoint` suite all build their plans by calling
//! `llama_like_metal`, and `driver-wgpu` needs no adapter, no toolchain and
//! no Mac to do it. So the SHAPE of every statement below — its operands,
//! its widths, what it records — is under test on an ordinary Linux box;
//! what waits on a Mac is only whether Metal's own PSOs match.
//!
//! ONE DECISION worth stating, because it will look like an omission:
//! the quantized entrypoints are spelled by their BASE name
//! (`affine_qmv_fast`), not with the checkpoint's affine suffix
//! (`..._bfloat16_gs_64_b_4`, `AffineFormat::kernel_suffix()`). The
//! suffix is the driver's binding of a checkpoint fact, in the same
//! class as the stream and the workspace scratch — it selects no
//! different arithmetic and no different arm. What the text chooses is
//! the kernel FAMILY.

    // `multi_batch` is the other axis, and it is a DIFFERENT KERNEL

    // n = 2048, about 527 GB/s against some 5% of fp16 peak. Bandwidth,
    // not arithmetic. The tiled kernel stages a run of keys in
    // threadgroup memory and lets 32 query rows share it, so the run is
    // read once instead of 32 times.

    // one, and `every_text_names_a_symbol_this_build_compiles` is what
    // would say so.

    // AND A THIRD KERNEL AT ONE WIDTH. `sdpa_paged_mma` tiles the same 32
    // rows, but a simdgroup owns eight of them and multiplies 8x8
    // fragments on the matrix unit instead of owning one row and adding

    // other width, and the match falls through to it.
