//! L0: driver selection and the registry — the `DriverSpec`/`DriverBackend`
//! store (`backend`), the concrete seams behind it, channel endpoint
//! lifecycle (`channel`), and the launch-side re-exports the rest of the
//! engine reads.
//!
//! # What this layer is now
//!
//! It is the ENGINE's half of the driver boundary and nothing else. The
//! contract — [`Driver`](driver_api::Driver) and the fourteen verbs, the
//! completion a driver mints, the bind plan, the registration a driver
//! answers — is `driver-api`'s, because both sides say it. What is left here
//! is what only the engine does: pick a backend, keep it in a registry under
//! a `DriverId`, and hold the channel endpoints applications wait on.
//!
//! Four modules went in that split, and it is worth saying which:
//!
//! * `completion` and `instance` moved to `driver-api`. A driver MINTS a
//!   completion — five of the trait's verbs return one — and answers a
//!   `BoundInstance`, so neither could stay in a crate the contract cannot
//!   name.
//! * `command` and `submission` were seven-line `pub use` shims for types
//!   `driver-api` already owned. They are deleted; consumers name the owner.
//! * `abi` marshalled runtime-owned plans into `#[repr(C)]` descriptors so a
//!   driver could take them apart again. Its own header had already deleted
//!   the frame for that reason ("the round trip bought nothing but the loss
//!   of the types"); the other two descriptors went the same way when the
//!   CUDA seam stopped being a C ABI.
//!
//! Strictly leaf: no `crate::{store,scheduler,pipeline,inferlet,server}`
//! imports. That claim was here before and was false — `backend.rs` called
//! `crate::pipeline::program::lookup` to splice host-generated kernels into a
//! registration. The splice is
//! [`crate::pipeline::program::with_host_codegen`]'s now, called by the
//! scheduler that owns the driver handle, which is also the layer that knows
//! which driver a plan is bound for.
//!
//! The per-`driver_id` dispatch verbs (`register_program`, `bind_instance`,
//! the `copy_*` family, ...) live in the scheduler dispatch facade, because
//! they need its driver-id -> handle registry to reach the `BatchScheduler`
//! that owns a given driver instance.
