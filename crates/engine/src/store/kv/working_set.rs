//! Thin WIT/resource handle for `kv-working-set` (kv_refact.md,
//! `store/kv/working_set.rs`). All substantive operations delegate to the
//! owning `KvStore`, resolved through `store::registry` by `(model, driver)`.
//!
//! [`KvWorkingSet`] is a lightweight `Clone` (not `Copy`) handle: every clone
//! shares one [`Arc<KvLifecycle>`]. Reading a clone out of the
//! `ResourceTable` (to inspect its fields, or resolve the owning store,
//! without holding the table borrow across an await/lock) is safe and free
//! of side effects — [`KvLifecycle`]'s idempotent release only runs when the
//! LAST outstanding `Arc` clone drops (ordinary Rust reference counting), so
//! a temporary clone dropped at the end of a host function never triggers an
//! early release while the table's own clone is still alive.
//!
//! `HostKvWorkingSet::drop` (the explicit WIT path,
//! `inferlet::host::kv_working_set`) additionally calls
//! [`KvWorkingSet::release`] synchronously right away, which both performs
//! the release NOW and marks it done — so the eventual `Arc` drop (when the
//! table's clone is deleted and goes out of scope) is a no-op. If instead a
//! `ResourceTable`/`ProcessCtx` is torn down directly and the WIT `drop`
//! glue is bypassed entirely, the table's clone is the only reference left
//! and ITS `Drop` performs the release — the process-teardown fallback.
