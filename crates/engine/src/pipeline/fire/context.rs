//! The narrow surface [`fire`](super)'s orchestration needs from its caller:
//! WASM component resource-table access (to get/get_mut/delete/push
//! `Resource<Channel>`/`Resource<ForwardPass>`/`Resource<Pipeline>` handles)
//! and the calling process's identity (the planner's FCFS key). This
//! trait names no `inferlet`/`ProcessCtx` type — only the external
//! `wasmtime::component::ResourceTable` leaf type and `uuid::Uuid` — so
//! `pipeline/` stays strictly below `inferlet/` in the layering.
//! `inferlet::host` (L4) implements it for `ProcessCtx`.
