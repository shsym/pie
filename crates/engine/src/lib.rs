//! Pie - Programmable Inference Engine

// ── The native execution shells ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// This crate's `driver::backend::{cuda,metal}` declare the `extern "C"`
// entry points; the archives that define them are built by these crates. A
// crate rustc never loads contributes no native-library records, so without
// `extern crate ... as _` the declarations link against nothing -- which is
// exactly what `cargo test -p pie-engine --features driver-cuda` did before
// the drivers were crates: undefined `pie_cuda_create`, `pie_cuda_launch`,
// and eight more. `as _` because there is nothing to call.
#[cfg(feature = "driver-cuda")]
extern crate driver_cuda as _;
#[cfg(feature = "driver-metal")]
