//! The seam to `driver-metal-new`.
//!
//! # A library call, not an ABI crossing
//!
//! The CUDA seam beside this one goes through the C ABI —
//! `pie_cuda_create`, `pie_cuda_launch`, a `*mut PieDriver` — because the
//! driver it talks to is C++. This one does not, because the driver it talks
//! to is Rust, and a `#[repr(C)]` boundary between two Rust crates is a second
//! spelling of a contract they already share.
//!
//! That is `metal.md`'s task 9 arriving early and from the other end: the C
//! boundary retires when its last C++ consumer does, and nothing here adds a
//! new one.
//!
//! # What is servable today, and what is not
//!
//! The verbs split cleanly. `create`, `device_facts`, the registry four and
//! `close_*` are answered by machinery that is already ported and device
//! tested. `encode` refuses, as the CUDA side does — Metal media encode is
//! unsupported on both. `launch`, `copy_kv`, `copy_state` and `resize_pool`
//! need the **KV pool**, which is the frame bridge's device half and the one
//! piece still missing.
//!
//! Those four refuse by name rather than being absent. A backend that cannot
//! be selected teaches nothing; one that is selected and says exactly which
//! verb it cannot serve is a working seam with a stated hole.
