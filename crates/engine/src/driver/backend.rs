//! The driver registry: a [`DriverSpec`] and the [`Driver`] it is paired
//! with, addressed by `DriverId`.
//!
//! # What this module stopped being
//!
//! It was the dispatcher. `DriverBackend` was an `enum` of five variants and
//! fourteen `match`es over them — seventy arms, every body a forward — plus
//! two more `match`es (`kind`, `device_domain`) that answered a driver's own
//! properties on the driver's behalf.
//!
//! All of it is [`driver_api::Driver`] now, and `DriverBackend` is a
//! `Box<dyn Driver>`. What that deleted, besides the arms:
//!
//! * **The size tuning.** Two variants were `Box`ed with `size_of`
//!   measurements in their doc comments, a third carried an
//!   `expect(clippy::large_enum_variant)` saying the real fix was "eighteen
//!   call sites in code no backend here owns", and every registry entry paid
//!   the widest variant's width on every build. A trait object is one word.
//! * **A test that could only exist because of the shape.**
//!   `each_backend_names_its_own_memory` checked that this crate had not
//!   answered one backend's memory domain for another — a mistake only
//!   possible while the `match` lived here. A driver states its own domain
//!   now, so the test has nothing left to catch and is gone with the arm.
//! * **The layering lie.** This module's header said "strictly leaf: no
//!   `crate::{store,scheduler,pipeline,...}` imports" while
//!   `register_program` called `crate::pipeline::program::lookup` and a test
//!   called `crate::scheduler::device_domain`. The host-codegen splice that
//!   needed the first is `pipeline::program::with_host_codegen`'s now, called
//!   by the scheduler that owns the driver handle; the claim is true as
//!   written for the first time.
//!
//! Selecting a backend is `open`'s: one function per device, each answering
//! the same `Box<dyn Driver>`.
