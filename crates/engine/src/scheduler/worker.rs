// Driver lane (V6 iteration 48)
// =============================================================================
//
// A dedicated thread owns the `DriverBackend` and executes EVERY driver call
// in FIFO post order, so the driver keeps the exact single-threaded
// serialization it has always had — no driver-side concurrency is introduced.
// What changes is who blocks: launch submit (1.2–2.5 ms) and lifecycle
// controls (0.16 ms p50 with 2–10 ms allocator tails) leave the scheduler
// worker's critical path, which must otherwise fit inside the run-ahead
// pipelining window (the measured 283–437 ms/run of
// sched-lag-after-wait-all — the fast/slow boot-mode spread — and the
// 66–88 ms/run of control-occupancy wave gaps).
//
// Division of state:
// - The lane owns the driver and the `channels` registry set (only control
//   execution ever touched it).
// - The worker keeps ALL policy and admission state: the frame policy, `pending`,
//   `instances` (read by launch admission and gather on every pass). Control
//   arms that used to mutate `instances` inline are split: the driver half
//   runs on the lane, and the map mutation + response happen back on the
//   worker when the lane's reply arrives (`apply_lane_reply`) — keeping the
//   invariant that a bind's response is sent only AFTER the instance is
//   admissible, on the same thread that admits launches.
// - Replies ride the scheduler's own channel (`SchedulerItem::Lane`), so a
//   reply wakes the worker exactly like any other event.

/// A [`FrameSubmission`] in transit to the driver lane.
///
/// SAFETY: the submission is `!Send` only through its
/// `Vec<*mut TerminalCell>` — raw pointers into the driver's pinned
/// terminal-cell slots, which are process-stable allocations with no thread
/// affinity (the driver itself reads them from its own threads today). The
/// submission is built complete on the worker, moved to the lane, and
/// consumed exactly once by `driver.launch` — the same single-consumer
/// discipline as the worker-inline call this replaces, with the backing
/// requests kept alive in `in_flight_launches` until the frame retires
/// (retire happens strictly after the lane's reply).
