//! The plan-derived site table: model-structural divergence sites, read
//! off the traced form.
//!
//! This is the Stage 5 "sites come from the traced form" step the
//! [`SITE_EXPERT_WEIGHTS`](super::SITE_EXPERT_WEIGHTS) doc promised:
//! [`derive_sites`] walks a `model_ir::ForwardPlan` and emits the sites
//! the model's own structure declares — divergence that holds for every
//! member of every fire against this model, as opposed to the per-fire
//! attachment divergence [`plan_fire`](super::plan_fire) derives from
//! [`MemberFacts`](super::MemberFacts) (the two provenances; see the parent
//! module doc). [`plan_fire_with_model`](super::plan_fire_with_model)
//! merges both when a caller supplies a plan.
//!
//! # What the walk recognizes
//!
//! One pattern today: an op with a per-token weight selector —
//! `OpKind::Matmul { selector: Some(_) }`, the expert-indexed grouped GEMM
//! whose weight is a template (`layer.{l}.expert.{e}.gate_up`) resolved per
//! token by a `TopK` value. That is `Div::Weight` at token granularity
//! ([`expert_weights_site`](super::expert_weights_site)), and its
//! parameters are derived as follows:
//!
//! * `top_k` — from the `TopK { k }` op producing the selector. The
//!   `TraceBuilder::matmul_per_token` invariant (the selector must be a
//!   `dyn PerToken` value, which only `topk` creates) guarantees that
//!   producer exists in every in-vocabulary trace; a plan violating it is a
//!   tracer bug and panics here rather than mis-planning silently.
//! * `experts` — from the trailing `Dim::Const` of the `TopK` op's input
//!   (the router logits): the selector's indices index exactly that axis.
//!   Note what is NOT the source: the weight template itself. The string
//!   `layer.{l}.expert.{e}.gate_up` does not bound `{e}` — template
//!   cardinality is a *binding* fact the driver's weight resolver knows and
//!   the plan alone does not — so the router logits width is the only
//!   honest in-plan derivation. (For a hypothetical fragment taking the
//!   selector itself as a producer-less parameter, both `top_k` and
//!   `experts` would be underivable from the plan alone; no family traces
//!   such a fragment, and the builder invariant above rules it out.)
//!
//! Per-layer repetition dedups: an MoE model traces one `TopK` + two
//! selector-carrying matmuls per layer, all with the same `(experts, k)`,
//! and the site is a fact about the MODEL, so the table emits one site per
//! distinct parameterization, in first-appearance order — not one per
//! layer.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT a site: per-request recurrent state
//!
//! A GDN trace's `CausalConv1d`/`GatedDelta` ops address per-layer,
//! PER-REQUEST state slabs (`StateRef { store: RecurrentState }`), and it
//! is tempting to read that as another model-structural site. It is not,
//! and the distinction is the module's sharpest line: a divergence site is
//! a place where co-batched members want *different computation* — a
//! lowering must be chosen (prefix, per-lane spans, grouped GEMM, a
//! branch). RS-touching ops compute the SAME operation for every member;
//! each member merely addresses its own slab, exactly as every member
//! already addresses its own KV pages. What RS presence changes is
//! *admission*: the rs-buffer's capacity/aliasing hazard forces such fires
//! solo today (the scheduler's hand-maintained `touches_rs_buffer()`,
//! whose traced-form statement is `plan.ops.iter().any(|op|
//! op.kind.state_ref() ..)` — see `model_ir::trace::OpKind::state_ref`).
//! That is a scheduling constraint, a fact for the admission rule
//! (`LaunchGrouping::accepts`), not a `Site` with a lowering; deriving it
//! from the plan belongs to the increment that wires plans to the
//! scheduler, on the admission side.
//!
//! # How the model sites reach `build_frame_submission` (landed via capabilities)
//!
//! The engine does NOT trace. It could seemingly do so at boot —
//! `bootstrap` holds the `ModelConfig` (an `arch_name`, driver configs)
//! and `model-compiler` is a direct rlib dep, so calling the family entry fn
//! is one line — but facts construction is where it breaks: the family fns
//! take facts the runtime does not have. `LlamaLikeFacts::fused_qkv`,
//! `Qwen35GdnFacts::fused_in_proj` etc. are BINDING facts — truths about
//! what the driver's deployment actually bound (contract joins/splits,
//! env-gated fusions like `PIE_QWEN35_FUSED_GDN_PROJ`) — and the rest come
//! from the checkpoint's config.json, which the runtime also does not
//! parse. The DRIVER is the party that traces, from exactly that evidence:
//! `declared_facts.cpp` builds facts from `HfConfig` plus the model's live
//! bindings, traces through the ABI, and structurally VALIDATES the traced
//! form against the real config and bound weight set. A runtime-side trace
//! built from guessed binding facts would be a second, unvalidated
//! derivation that can silently diverge from the plan the driver validated
//! — the exact class of drift this project exists to remove.
//!
//! That names the honest route, and the route is NOT yet wired. What the
//! paragraph below described in the past tense is a design, and every one of
//! its three links is currently open — written out because a plan in the
//! past tense is worse than no plan at all.
//!
//! The design: the driver reports its validated plan's SITE SUMMARY through
//! the capabilities handshake. The CUDA driver would walk its declared plan
//! with a C++ mirror of [`derive_sites`] and emit a `model_site_summary`
//! capability row (`::driver_api::ModelSiteSummary` — empty when
//! `PIE_DECLARED_FORWARD` is off, the validation refused, or the plan is
//! dense). The summary would ride `DriverCapabilities` → worker `translate`
//! → `bootstrap::DriverConfig` → `DriverSpec`, where the scheduler picks it
//! up at spawn, maps it through [`summary_sites`], and
//! `build_frame_submission` merges the result into every fire via
//! [`plan_fire_with_model`](super::plan_fire_with_model).
//!
//! Where it stands, measured:
//!
//! 1. PRODUCER. `driver-cuda`'s `serve/load.rs` sets
//!    `model_site_summary: ModelSiteSummary::default()`, and no
//!    `derive_expert_site_summary` exists in this tree. The C++ mirror is
//!    unwritten, so the row is always empty at the source.
//! 2. CARRIER. `worker::translate` does copy `caps.model_site_summary`
//!    into its config, but [`DriverSpec`](crate::driver::DriverSpec) has
//!    three fields and none of them is this one. The summary stops there.
//! 3. CONSUMER. [`summary_sites`] has no caller outside its own tests.
//!
//! None of this is a live defect: the doc's last sentence is still true —
//! sites are INFORMATIONAL this increment, nothing downstream consumes a
//! fire plan's site vec, and an absent summary is exactly today's behavior.
//! The tests below pin the derivation so the mapping stays correct until
//! the three links close, and the empty path is the one that runs.
