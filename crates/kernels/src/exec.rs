//! The execution walk, written once, generic over any [`Dispatch`]
//! (design §8): split a plan into its prepare and capture phases
//! ([`phases`]), then run node indices in program order under their guards
//! ([`walk`], or [`fire`] for both phases eagerly). The contract and the one
//! loop written over it live together — a driver that implements the traits
//! next door gets the walk from the same crate.
//!
//! Deliberately policy-free: rows-bucketing, graph capture itself, and
//! memoization of plan ops are the concrete drivers' business (`driver-cuda`,
//! `driver-metal`) — this module only states *what* runs and in *what order*,
//! never how a backend amortizes it. No async, no threads: a fire is one
//! ordered pass over one queue.
