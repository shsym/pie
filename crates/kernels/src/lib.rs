//! ② KERNEL SIGNATURES — the vocabulary. The rows live with the kernels
//! (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` ②).
//!
//! `dsl::cuda` has ten wrappers over five attention kernels because
//! `_region` / `_planned` / `_capture` / `_dequant` encode the DISPATCH
//! CONTEXT in the wrapper name. The context is a property of the call site;
//! what belongs to the kernel is its symbol and its contract. A [`KernelSig`]
//! is that contract, once per symbol.
//!
//! Four declarations, each replacing something that is a hand-written runtime
//! rule today:
//!
//! | declaration | replaces |
//! |---|---|
//! | `whole`   | `if c.head_dim_padded \|\| (window_one && c.xqa_decode)` in the model body |
//! | `lacks`   | "a score-wanting program under XQA fails loudly PTIR-side" (a C++ throw) |
//! | `needs`   | the prepare a stated kernel obligates, named nowhere |
//! | `sink`    | `emit_cuda::emit_masked_pages_bracket`'s hardcoded page substitution |
//!
//! `whole` is CHECKED at trace time — which is load time, since a declaration
//! is traced when the model loads. The other three are declared but not yet
//! consumed: `needs`/`sink` are the emitter's knowledge until the launch ABI
//! flattens (migration step 6), and `lacks` needs the deployment's
//! servable-seam set, which is the support-matrix work. Declaring them first
//! is the point — the table is where they land, and it exists.
//!
//! ## Why this is its own crate
//!
//! The rows are in [`kernels-cuda`](../kernels_cuda/index.html) and
//! [`kernels-metal`](../kernels_metal/index.html), one crate per backend,
//! each beside the `.cu`/`.metal` it describes — so a new kernel is one
//! source file and one table row in the same directory and the same diff
//! hunk. Both tables have to be written in the same words, and neither
//! backend owns those words, so they are here.
//!
//! Bare-named for the same reason [`driver`](../driver/index.html) is: it is
//! the shared floor under a `-`-prefixed pair, holding what both members
//! speak rather than anything either one does. Nothing depends on it but the
//! two tables and the compiler that reads them, and it depends on nothing at
//! all — a row must be writable next to its kernel without dragging a
//! dependency graph along.

/// A capability a seam may ask of the kernel covering its rows. Named after
/// the seam vocabulary (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` ①), because that is what a
/// `lacks` line refuses to serve.
