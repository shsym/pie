//! ② KERNEL SIGNATURES — the vocabulary. The rows live with the kernels
//! (`.wiki/tart/dsl.md` ②).
//!
//! `dsl::cuda` has ten wrappers over five attention kernels because
//! `_region` / `_planned` / `_capture` / `_dequant` encode the DISPATCH
//! CONTEXT in the wrapper name. The context is a property of the call site;
//! what belongs to the kernel is its symbol and its contract. A [`KernelSig`]
//! is that contract, once per symbol.
//!
//! Four declarations, each replacing something that is a hand-written runtime
//! rule today:
//!
//! | declaration | replaces |
//! |---|---|
//! | `whole`   | `if c.head_dim_padded \|\| (window_one && c.xqa_decode)` in the model body |
//! | `lacks`   | "a score-wanting program under XQA fails loudly PTIR-side" (a C++ throw) |
//! | `needs`   | the prepare a stated kernel obligates, named nowhere |
//! | `sink`    | `emit_cuda::emit_masked_pages_bracket`'s hardcoded page substitution |
//!
//! `whole` is CHECKED at trace time — which is load time, since a declaration
//! is traced when the model loads. The other three are declared but not yet
//! consumed: `needs`/`sink` are the emitter's knowledge until the launch ABI
//! flattens (migration step 6), and `lacks` needs the deployment's
//! servable-seam set, which is the support-matrix work. Declaring them first
//! is the point — the table is where they land, and it exists.
//!
//! ## Why this is its own crate
//!
//! The rows are in [`kernels-cuda`](../kernels_cuda/index.html) and
//! [`kernels-metal`](../kernels_metal/index.html), one crate per backend,
//! each beside the `.cu`/`.metal` it describes — so a new kernel is one
//! source file and one table row in the same directory and the same diff
//! hunk. Both tables have to be written in the same words, and neither
//! backend owns those words, so they are here.
//!
//! Bare-named for the same reason [`driver`](../driver/index.html) is: it is
//! the shared floor under a `-`-prefixed pair, holding what both members
//! speak rather than anything either one does. Nothing depends on it but the
//! two tables and the compiler that reads them, and it depends on nothing at
//! all — a row must be writable next to its kernel without dragging a
//! dependency graph along.

// ══ WHO READS THESE FIELDS — RE-MEASURED AFTER `ROW_TABLES` EMPTIED ═══════
//
// northstar §5.2 measured this mid-sweep and said so: *"this table is a
// snapshot, not a result -- re-measure after `ROW_TABLES` empties"*. It is
// empty now. What follows is that re-measurement, and it corrects §5.2 in
// two places.
//
// THE FORWARDER CENSUS IS FIVE, NOT THREE. §5.2 excluded three forwarders BY
// NAME (`kernels-{vulkan,wgpu,metal}/src/lib.rs`). There are five: those
// three, plus `kernels-cuda-new/src/table/mod.rs`'s `copy_sig` and
// `x/contract.rs`'s `Contract::sig`. Both of the missed pair are in
// `kernels-cuda-new`, which is exactly why four fields measured as
// "CUDA-only reads it" -- the exclusion list was blind to the crate the
// answer was about.
//
//   > A named exclusion list cannot see a forwarder written after it.
//
// The general test is `\bf\s*:\s*\w+\.f\b` -- a field copied onto
// itself -- which drops 127 hits where the name list dropped 57. And §5.2's
// description of them is wrong too: all four `copy_sig`s are
// `KernelSig -> KernelSig` const fns for array concatenation, NOT "a copy
// into a local type".
//
// THE RESULT, forwarders excluded, ranges excluded, comments excluded:
//
//   returns          DELETED -- not moved; see below
//   lowered_as       MOVED -- see `kernels_cuda_new::x::Contract`
//   publishes_aux    MOVED -- see `kernels_cuda_new::x::Contract`
//   lacks            NOBODY               see below -- NOT a candidate
//   needs            model-compiler   1   frontend reads it
//   depth_prefix_plan  model 2, model-compiler 1   frontend reads it
//   axes             kernels          3   only this crate's own covers_point
//   everything else                       live in a portable backend
//
// ALL THREE OF STEP 9'S SUBJECTS HAVE GONE, and their rows go with them -- a
// census that outlives its subject becomes a census of history, which is
// what `driver-cuda/BRIDGE_RETIREMENT.md`'s section 2 table turned into.
//
// TWO WERE MOVED. `lowered_as` and `publishes_aux` are
// `kernels_cuda_new::x::Contract`'s now, and neither move was a relocation:
// `lowered_as` was DECLARED on a contract all along and merely copied onto
// the derived row, and `publishes_aux` joined it. That is why `Contract` was
// the right owner and no other candidate was weighed -- it already held two
// of the three. The measurements that made them safe are recorded there and
// not here, because the question each turns on -- which lookup answers over
// which population -- is a fact about CUDA's registries and not about this
// struct.
//
// ONE WAS DELETED, AND STEP 9 SAID MOVE. `returns` had ZERO non-empty
// writers in the tree: all eight writers wrote `""`, and the doc that stood
// here claimed "the tree carries two of the three" `bool` launchers when all
// three had been deleted by §43 and §45. It was not moved to `Contract`
// because `Contract`'s own doc lists `returns` among the five it drops as
// having "described a launcher rather than a statement" -- and because
// moving it would have been the DANGEROUS option: `device_typecheck`'s rows
// are `families`/`unit!` device rows rather than contract-derived ones, so a
// `x::contract` lookup there would answer `None` and the guard would stop
// checking in silence. Deleting made its condition unrepresentable instead.
// That is a behaviour change and is stated as one; it was not inherited from
// the refactor.
//

// `lacks` IS NOT SURPLUS -- ITS READER IS MISSING. Zero readers, and

// that asymmetry matters. Raised as a correctness question. DO NOT DELETE.
//
// AND `Cap` IS A HOMONYM THAT COLLIDES ON ITS VARIANTS. `kernels::Cap` is
// `{Scores, PageMaskSink}`; `model_compiler::dsl::Cap` (`dsl.rs:1681`) is a
// SECOND, independent enum `{Transform, Observe, Scores, PageMaskSink, Put,
