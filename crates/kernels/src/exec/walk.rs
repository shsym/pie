/// Standing rules, inherited rather than enforced here:
///
/// - `exec` is enqueue/encode only, never sync (#15) — so a completed walk
///   means the work is *queued*, and this same loop runs identically inside a
///   graph capture.
/// - Merge values need no execution: a φ is data, not an op (`Def::Merge`
///   never appears in `Plan::nodes`) — the compiler aliased its branches onto
///   one arena slot, so there is nothing to walk past.
/// - Ordering between cache writers and readers is program order, which this
///   walk preserves by construction: nodes fire in the sequence given, on one
///   queue.
