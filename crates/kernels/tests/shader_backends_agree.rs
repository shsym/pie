//! The three shader backends' tables, compared.
//!
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §0: the three are **one table written
//! down three times**. Measured over all 300 statements: the 100 names are the
//! same set in all three, `launch` is identical in 100 of 100 rows, `axes` in
//! 100 of 100, `operands` agrees on 94 of 100 — and the statements that differ
//! are drift rather than difference.
//!
//! **Nothing in this workspace compared them**, which is why the drift was
//! found by three greps in an afternoon rather than by a test, and why it had
//! been there long enough that nobody could say which side was right. This is
//! the missing comparison, and it is the same defect class
//! `refactor-plan-followup.md` §0 named once and generally: *a hand-transcribed
//! fact outlived the test that checked it.*
//!
//! # Why it is here and not later
//!
//! The bigplan's §3 gate compares `ROUTINES` — derived argument lists — and
//! cannot exist until the ports do. This one compares the tables that exist
//! today, and it is Stage 0's verification: *"settle the seven drifted
//! statements and make the three tables agree, so what gets frozen into three
//! sets of bodies is one decision rather than an accident."* A cleanup that
//! lands without it blesses whatever it finds.
//!
//! When a backend crosses to routines its rows leave `KERNELS`, and this test
//! compares what is left. It goes quiet family by family and the §3 gate takes
//! over; that hand-off is deliberate and is why both exist.
//!
//! # What is compared, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! Compared: the name set, and per name `launch`, `axes`, the operand list
//! (type, nullability and source, in order), the four `*_param` columns,
//! `whole`, `in_place` and `depth_prefix_plan`. These are facts about the
//! KERNEL.
//!
//! Not compared: `file` (three shader languages, three extensions), `symbol`
//! spellings beyond the row name, and anything about a device. Those are
//! properly per-backend, and a gate that failed on them would be a gate people
//! learn to edit.

// THREE TESTS STOOD HERE, and each of them said in its own failure message
// exactly when to delete it. All three now say it.
//
// * `a_ported_routine_takes_exactly_the_operands_its_row_states` compared a
//   crossed routine's signature against the ROW of the same name on the same
//   backend -- the strongest check in the fleet while a family was mid-
//   crossing, because it held the new plane to the old one, on the same
//   kernel, in the same crate. Its message: *"no kernel is stated twice, so
//   this compared nothing."*
// * `a_kernel_crossed_on_one_backend_is_compared_against_the_row_on_another`
//   did the same across backends, so a family that crossed on vulkan could
//   still be checked against metal's row. Its message: *"nothing was
//   compared."*
// * `the_crossed_routines_with_no_row_to_check_are_counted` existed to notice
//   the other two going quiet, and it is the one that fired first: *"0 of 99
//   crossed have a row to check"*, on every backend.
//
// ALL THREE now hold an empty `KERNELS`: `kernels-wgpu` was the last, and its
// final row was `silu_mul_strided` -- a kernel every backend had recorded as
// unable to take a positional argument list, which was true of MSL's flat
// argument table and false of `gated.wgsl`. There is no row left to hold a
// routine to, anywhere.
//
// What carries the signatures from here is
// `two_backends_that_crossed_the_same_kernel_agree_on_its_signature`, which is
// the same claim between two ROUTINE planes with the tables taken out of the
// middle -- and which grew as these shrank, which is the trade §3 was for.

/// The two settled drifts say something about a DRIVER, and this is what
/// keeps those sentences true.
///
/// `DRIFTED` does not merely record that two tables differ — for
/// `route_gather` and the six sdpa rows it says *which backend is wrong and
/// why*, and the why is a claim about a crate this test does not own:
///
/// * `driver-vulkan` reads `rows_param` **nowhere**, so it could not honour
///   the column even if its row carried it;
/// * `driver-metal` resolves `Source::AttentionMask` but mentions
///   `AttentionMaskStride` **nowhere**, so it stages a mask and reads its
///   pitch from a text scalar.
///
/// A judgement about another crate, written into a comment, is the shape this
/// workspace has had to correct repeatedly — so it is asked as a question
/// instead of asserted as an answer. When either driver learns to resolve its
/// column this fails, which is the moment the `DRIFTED` entry stops being
/// true and someone should be looking at it.
///
/// It reads sources rather than calling anything, because neither driver
/// builds on every host that runs this test.

// The other six `gdn_*` kernels were parked here as UNRESOLVED and are not

//
// (a) ELEMENT TYPES: metal now says `F32s`/`F32sMut` in the four positions
// where `gdn_core.metal` and `gdn_prep.metal` declare `device float*`. The
// typed spelling was not vulkan's preference, it was what all three trees
// declare, so metal took it.
//
// (b) ARITY: metal's extra trailing `Env<i32>` was the better statement and
// not an extra. Its grid takes `rows` and `v_heads` where vulkan took their
// PRODUCT, and the shader takes the product apart again -- `hv = z % Hv`,
// `row = z / Hv` -- so a body handed the product cannot tell one
// factorisation from another and two different routings with the same
// product address different state. Vulkan took metal's.
//
// What is left above is the part that really is two different shaders.

    // metal's four float planes stopped being spelled `Buf` when the MSL says
    // `device float*`, and vulkan stopped folding `rows * v_heads` into one
    // number the shader takes apart again. The thirty-fifth is
    // `copy_logits_bf16`, which wgpu and vulkan crossed against shader text
    // that does NOT agree -- wgpu's writes two vocabulary entries per lane and
    // vulkan's writes one -- and the signatures match anyway, because a grid
    // is not an operand. That is the gate's shape working as intended: it
    // compares what a caller must pass, and leaves what a lane does to the
    // family tests that can see the shader.

    // Plus `norm`'s twelve, and they paid the same way: metal's crossing
    // showed that the four PACKED reductions need `width` as well as `axis`,
    // because their base is `group * axis_size` and a row holds `width / axis`
    // of them. Vulkan was launching one workgroup per ROW, which normalizes
    // the first head of a q/k norm and leaves the other thirty-one as the
    // projection wrote them. It took metal's signature. Four of the twelve are
    // in DIVERGED for a difference that really is two shaders -- metal sizes
    // its threadgroup on the axis, vulkan compiles a fixed 256 and loops.

    // groups of three, and the other seven matched on the first attempt --
    // including all three routed matvecs, whose twelve arguments are the
    // longest signature either backend has agreed on without an edit.
    //
    // Plus `attn`'s sixteen, fifteen of which matched at once. That includes
    // `kv_append_paged`'s sixteen slots, six of them a ring ABI neither
    // backend reads and both name one by one.
    //
    // Plus `quant`'s thirty-one -- the largest family and the one that needed
    // the least argument, because both backends were ported from the same MLX
    // bodies and the 303 instantiation names are spelled identically. Every
    // one of them agreed.
