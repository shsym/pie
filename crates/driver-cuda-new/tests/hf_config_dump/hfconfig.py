"""Parsing `model/config.hpp` into a field list.

One parser, imported by every emitter. There used to be two copies — the C++
one here and the Rust one under `model/config/` — and the same bug had
to be found and fixed in both, twice: declarations whose line ends in a `//`
comment (24 fields, `head_dim` and `use_qk_norm` among them), then a field that
brace-initializes without `=` (`upsampling_ratios{8, 6, 5, 4}`). Both times the
generated output looked fine, because a field missing from an emitter is a
field missing silently.

So the parse lives once, and it refuses to return a partial answer.
