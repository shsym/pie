//! The union lowering: guards KEPT rather than answered.
//!
//! `lower()` reads the fire's rows, decides every `GuardPred`, and emits
//! only the arm that won — which is what makes the eager executor simple
//! and what makes a union supergraph impossible, because the flat list is
//! already specialised to one fire's variant bits.
//!
//! `lower_with(.., GuardMode::Union)` decides nothing. What this file
//! proves, GPU-free, is the three properties `executor::run_captured`
//! walks on:
//!
//! * the tree is well-formed — every parent is in range, and the two arms
//!   of a chain node are recognisable as siblings;
//! * the launch order is WELL-NESTED — a region, once left, is never
//!   returned to, which is what lets the walk be a stack diff instead of a
//!   sort;
//! * the union is a SUPERSET — it emits at least what the resolved
//!   lowering does, because it emits every arm rather than one.
