//! The shell's hand-built KV views against `store::kv_cache_live`'s.
//!
//! `abi_shell::kv_pools_for` builds a `KvCacheLayerView` per layer by
//! hand: two `cudaMalloc`s per source layer, a `kv_source` lookup to
//! point shared layers at their owner's pages, and fifteen fields filled
//! literally. `store::kv_cache_live::KvCache::layer_view` does the same
//! thing from a planned layout, and has since the port — with envelopes,
//! quantized formats and the scale planes the shell's version cannot
//! express.
//!
//! One of the two is a shape nobody calls. That is what
//! `store-caches-wired` is about, and this is the test that has to come
//! first: **before replacing the shell's views with the live cache's,
//! prove the live cache produces the same views for the shapes the shell
//! actually uses.** A swap that changed a field nobody compared would be
//! a wrong answer in the one place — the KV cache — where a wrong answer
//! looks like a slightly worse model rather than a bug.
//!
//! # What this does NOT claim
//!
//! That the swap is safe to make. It is not, yet, and the reason is not
//! about views: `KvCache` has no `Drop` and `LiveKvCacheOps::alloc_tensor`
//! is a bare `cudaMalloc`, so every pool growth would leak both tiers.
//! The shell's `KvState` holds `DeviceBuffer`s that free themselves. That
//! is the next piece of work and it is an OWNERSHIP change, not a
//! geometry one — which is exactly the separation this test buys.
