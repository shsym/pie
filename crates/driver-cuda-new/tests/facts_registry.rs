//! Which `model_type` this shell can OPEN, held against what the loader
//! can author.
//!
//! §3.3 of the plan reads: "the executor has arms for more than it can
//! load — nemotron_h, gemma3n, gpt-oss/mixtral, gemma-2 all dispatch but
//! cannot be opened, because facts derivation and the weight binder are
//! per-family and were only written three times."
//!
//! That sentence was true and nothing enforced it, which is the problem:
//! the gap was a paragraph in a document rather than a list a build could
//! check. Before the registry it could not even be stated, because the
//! shell decided the family by SNIFFING weight names — there was no set to
//! enumerate, and a model type nobody had thought about was answered by
//! whichever sniff happened to match rather than refused.
//!
//! So this file closes it the way `executor_bind.rs` closes the unarmed
//! symbols: as a set that must be exactly right. A family that gains a
//! derivation leaves `NOT_YET_OPENABLE`; a family that appears in the
//! loader and nowhere else joins it deliberately, in a commit, rather than
//! being discovered by a checkpoint that will not boot.
