//! The two control kernels: readiness before a pass, the commit bump after it.
//!
//! # Why these are compiled here rather than linked
//!
//! The host emitter produces one kind of kernel for CUDA — a fused region per
//! generated region — and emits no readiness kernel and no commit kernel,
//! because on CUDA those are *prebuilt*. The C++ driver's prebuilt copies live
//! in `driver-cuda/csrc/src/pipeline/channels.hpp`, a private header of a
//! crate this one is replacing. They are not in `libpie_kernels_cuda.a`: the
//! kernel table has no row for them, `kernels-cuda/csrc` includes
//! `channels.hpp` nowhere, and `driver-cuda-new --features bridge` therefore
//! links an archive containing neither symbol.
//!
//! So they have to come from somewhere, and there are two honest options: add
//! them to the kernels crate and build them with nvcc, or compile them here
//! through the NVRTC path this driver already has for every emitted region.
//!
//! This file takes the second, and the reason is the toolkit-free build. A
//! kernels-crate row would mean `driver-cuda-new` cannot run a PTIR program
//! without `bridge`, which needs nvcc *at build time* — and that build is
//! load-bearing for CI. Compiling forty lines through the NVRTC path already
//! in `super::nvrtc` costs one compile per process, is cached on disk beside
//! every other region, and needs no toolkit at build time at all.
//!
//! # These are ports and reproduce the C++ exactly
//!
//! Both bodies are transcriptions of `channels.hpp:93-149`, including the
//! `threadIdx.x != 0 || blockIdx.x != 0` guard that makes each a single-thread
//! kernel, and including the ORDER of the commit loops — puts before takes.
//! The order matters for a channel that is both taken and put in one pass (a
//! loop-carried ping-pong): publishing first and consuming second is what
//! leaves such a ring with the value the pass produced rather than with the
//! one it consumed.
//!
//! # The types are spelled in bare C
//!
//! `unsigned char` and `unsigned int`, not `std::uint8_t`/`std::uint32_t`.
//! NVRTC compiles these with **no include path at all** — the same condition
//! the emitted regions are compiled under — so `<cstdint>` cannot be found and
//! `std::` does not exist. The M1 runtime prologue solves the same problem the
//! same way, with its `m1_u8`/`m1_u32` typedefs, and says so in its own
//! header comment.
