//! What a loaded checkpoint costs this device, for the memory planner.
//!
//! [`ModelCosts`](super::memory_planner::ModelCosts) is the planner's model of
//! the checkpoint: how many bytes a KV token takes, how big the arena grows
//! with the forward shape, what a recurrent slot costs. The planner takes it
//! as a parameter rather than computing it, which is what lets the lattice be
//! exercised without a GPU or a checkpoint — and which is why, until now, the
//! only implementation was a test's.
//!
//! This is the production one. Every figure comes from the thing that actually
//! allocates it, never from a second statement of the same layout:
//!
//! - the arena is [`WorkspaceLayout::cpp_budget_bytes`], which is the same
//!   walk `allocate_full` makes. The C++ said that layout twice and they had
//!   drifted by 503 MB on a Qwen3-32B shape; there is one list here and the
//!   planner reads it.
//! - the attention float workspace is the constant the shell allocates.
//! - the KV token cost is the page geometry the fire path builds.
//!
//! A figure this gets wrong does not fail. It moves bytes between the arena
//! and the KV pool, and the symptom is a pool that is too small (fewer
//! contexts than the card can hold) or too large (an out-of-memory at the
//! first wide prefill). That is why each one below names its source.
