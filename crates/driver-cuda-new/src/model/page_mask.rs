//! The page mask: `FirePageMask` and the hook-graph prepare pass that has to
//! predict it exactly.
//!
//! Port of `driver-cuda/csrc/src/model/attn_page_mask.{hpp,cu}`.
//!
//! # What the object is
//!
//! `attn_page_mask` is the one PTIR sideband that flows *into* the backend: a
//! program hands the model a per-page keep mask and the layer's attention is
//! expected to honour it. Honouring it is a page-table gather, not a kernel
//! change — FlashInfer already takes the page list as a launch argument — so
//! this type owns the mask, owns the gathered CSR the gather produces, and
//! owns nothing else.
//!
//! One instance brackets a whole layer loop. The page geometry belongs to the
//! fire, not to the layer, so the five buffers are carved once and every layer
//! reuses them.
//!
//! # The invariant this module is built around
//!
//! Two separate call paths compute the carve:
//!
//! - [`FirePageMask::new`], at fire time; and
//! - [`prepare_page_mask_capture`], during the hook-graph prepare pass, which
//!   **bakes the addresses it computes into a captured CUDA graph**.
//!
//! If those two disagree by one byte, the replayed graph writes its compacted
//! page table where the attention does not read, and the model attends over
//! stale pages with no error anywhere. So — exactly as the C++ does — there is
//! **one** layout function, [`MaskSlotLayout::plan`], and both paths call it.
//! The parity oracle records both carves for all eleven fire geometries and
//! compares them row by row; see `tests/page_mask_parity.rs`.
//!
//! This is the same shape as the `workspace_bytes` bug (`.wiki/kernel-refactor`
//! §8), where two hand-written walks of one layout drifted. The C++ here got it
//! right by construction, and the port keeps that property rather than
//! re-deriving it.
//!
//! # Why the keep rows have a fixed stride
//!
//! The obvious layout — one entry per page, sliced by the fire's page CSR —
//! forces the writer (host) and the reader (a device kernel walking the real
//! page table) to agree on that CSR, and they do not. On the decode-envelope
//! path the host holds a conservative *bound* while the device resolves the
//! real geometry itself. A per-request stride removes the page CSR from the
//! mask's addressing entirely: the only shared fact left is "slot `p` of
//! request `r`", which is exactly what a program means when it writes
//! `mask[p]`.
//!
//! A conservative host CSR therefore only ever over-allocates. It cannot
//! mis-address anything.
