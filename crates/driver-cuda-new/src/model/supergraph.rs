//! The union cache: one instantiated graph per (R, N) bucket.
//!
//! # What is in the key, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! A captured graph bakes in every address and every launch geometry it
//! recorded. So whatever a capture may not vary over has to be in the
//! key, and whatever it CAN vary over must not be — putting a variant bit
//! in the key is exactly how a union stops being a union and becomes N
//! separate captures with extra steps.
//!
//! In the key:
//!
//! * **R**, the request count, and **N**, the token count. The launch
//!   geometry is a function of them.
//! * the fire class. `Decode` and `Prefill` are different traces, not
//!   variants of one.
//! * which model is loaded. Two deployments share nothing.
//!
//! NOT in the key, and this is the whole point:
//!
//! * hook attachment, mask kind, correction arm, LoRA presence — every
//!   `GuardPred` axis. These are FOLDED: the union lowering emits all
//!   arms, the arms become conditional nodes, and a device predicate word
//!   selects between them per launch.
//!
//! The measure of success is that a bucket's exec count stays at one as
//! structurally-distinct requests arrive, rather than growing with the
//! number of distinct programs.
