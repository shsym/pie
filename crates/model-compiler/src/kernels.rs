//! ② KERNEL SIGNATURES — the compiler's end of the tables.
//!
//! The rows moved out. A kernel's contract belongs beside the kernel, so the
//! CUDA table is [`kernels_cuda::KERNELS`] and the Metal one is
//! [`kernels_metal::KERNELS`], each in the crate that also holds the `.cu` /
//! `.metal` it describes — one source file and one table row, same directory,
//! same diff hunk. The words a row is written in are the `kernels` crate's,
//! which is also where the reasons for `whole` / `needs` / `lacks` / `sink`
//! are written down.
//!
//! What stays here is what is about the COMPILER rather than about a kernel:
//! [`Backend`], which reads a backend out of a traced family name, and
//! [`check_plan`], which walks a [`ForwardPlan`]. Both are re-exported
//! through this module so call sites keep saying `kernels::sig(..)`.
//!
//! The tables are consumed with `default-features = false`, so reading a
//! symbol's contract does not build a single `.cu`.

// The vocabulary and the two tables, re-exported so this module reads as one
