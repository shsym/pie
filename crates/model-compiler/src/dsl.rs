//! The declaration surface (north-star-dsl.md, "the v2 surface").
//!
//! plan.md's sketch, made real: values carry the tape, so ops are free
//! functions and operators rather than builder methods; weights are typed
//! handles from a per-layer namespace, so no declaration spells a string
//! or a width; per-layer state is an object (`Kv::append`); and a LOWERED
//! declaration calls **raw kernel signatures** ([`cuda`]) — functions
//! named for the driver's launcher symbols, whose parameters are the
//! launcher's semantic operands — recording [`OpKind::Launch`] ops.
//!
//! The recording substrate is [`TraceBuilder`], unchanged: this module is
//! surface, not IR. The one behavioral subtlety lives in `+=`:
//!
//! * `y += matmul(&a, &w.o_proj)` — if the matmul is the op just
//!   recorded and nothing else consumed it, the tape REWRITES it to the
//!   `beta_one` accumulate form (`matmul_add`), the hand-written passes'
//!   cuBLAS residual fold. Output id unchanged, so the fold is invisible
//!   to dataflow.
//! * `y += anything_else` — a [`OpKind::ResidualAdd`] launch, exactly the
//!   post-norm landing the hand-written pass makes explicit.
//!
//! Op `layer` tags derive from what an op touches — its weight handle,
//! its state handle, or its first input — rather than from a bracketing
//! closure; the semantic goldens pin that this derivation reproduces the
//! bracketed tagging byte for byte.
