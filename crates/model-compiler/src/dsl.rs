//! The declaration surface (north-star-dsl.md, "the v2 surface").
//!
//! plan.md's sketch, made real: values carry the tape, so ops are free
//! functions and operators rather than builder methods; weights are typed
//! handles from a per-layer namespace, so no declaration spells a string
//! or a width; per-layer state is an object (`Kv::append`); and a LOWERED
//! declaration calls **raw kernel signatures** ([`cuda`]) — functions
//! named for the driver's launcher symbols, whose parameters are the
//! launcher's semantic operands — recording [`OpKind::Launch`] ops.
//!
//! The recording substrate is [`TraceBuilder`], unchanged: this module is
//! surface, not IR. The one behavioral subtlety lives in `+=`:
//!
//! * `y += matmul(&a, &w.o_proj)` — if the matmul is the op just
//!   recorded and nothing else consumed it, the tape REWRITES it to the
//!   `beta_one` accumulate form (`matmul_add`), the hand-written passes'
//!   cuBLAS residual fold. Output id unchanged, so the fold is invisible
//!   to dataflow.
//! * `y += anything_else` — a [`OpKind::ResidualAdd`] launch, exactly the
//!   post-norm landing the hand-written pass makes explicit.
//!
//! Op `layer` tags derive from what an op touches — its weight handle,
//! its state handle, or its first input — rather than from a bracketing
//! closure; the semantic goldens pin that this derivation reproduces the
//! bracketed tagging byte for byte.
//!
//! # On arity
//!
//! Seven functions here take eight arguments, and the paragraph above is
//! why: a declaration's parameters are the launcher's semantic operands,
//! so the arity is the KERNEL's and not this file's to choose. `rope`
//! takes a theta, a scale, a head dim, a rotary dim and a table flag
//! because rope does. Bundling them behind a struct would put a layer
//! between the surface and the symbol it is named for, which is the one
//! thing this surface exists not to do.
//!
//! The allow is module-wide rather than seven copies because the reason
//! is the module's, not any function's. A function here that is wide for
//! some OTHER reason is a real finding, and this hides it — the guard
//! against that is that a declaration which does not mirror a launcher
//! does not belong in this file at all.
