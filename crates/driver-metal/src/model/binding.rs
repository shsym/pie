//! What a Metal load OBSERVED, and the one door to the row's Metal text.
//!
//! # This file is what is left of `model/text.rs`
//!
//! That module held an eleven-entry table of architecture STRING names
//! (`LLAMA_LIKE`), a `canonical()` that reduced a spelling to one of them, a
//! `serves()` predicate over it, and a `facts_from_with()` that rebuilt the
//! model's own twenty-nine `LlamaLikeFacts` from NINE `has_tensor` probes. It
//! was **the third dispatch key** the catalog refactor exists to delete: a
//! checkpoint's identity was decided once by `catalog::identify` from the
//! tensors, and then decided again here from a string the row had handed out.
//!
//! Two keys for one identity is not a tidiness problem, and this crate has
//! the receipts for what it costs:
//!
//! * `LLAMA_LIKE` listed `"gemma4"` and `"gpt_oss"`, so `serve/load.rs`
//!   CLAIMED to serve them at its pre-staging gate and then refused them
//!   ninety lines later on a completely different ground — the checkpoint
//!   ships a `pre_feedforward_layernorm` and the projected geometry could
//!   only state a SiLU gate. One driver, two answers, and the second one
//!   arrived after 17 GB of weights had been staged.
//! * `facts_from_with` decided the norm variant by asking whether
//!   `layers.0.pre_feedforward_layernorm.weight` exists. gemma-4 publishes
//!   that norm and stores its gains as a plain multiplier, so the probe read
//!   `(1 + w)` for a stack that means `w` — a norm whose LARGEST value agreed
//!   with MLX to three digits while its ordinary ones were off by a third.
//!   A row states the fold; a tensor's existence never could.
//!
//! Both are unrepresentable now. `catalog::Variant::trace` takes a
//! `catalog::Deployed` whose `backend` says which driver is asking, so the
//! Metal text is the ROW's answer for the Metal backend, and a row this build
//! has no Metal text for refuses in the one place the CUDA driver's refusal
//! also lives.
//!
//! # What a driver may still say about a model, and why it is only this
//!
//! [`MetalBinding`] is six values and every one of them is about the BYTES
//! that arrived or about the KERNELS this binary was built with. None is
//! about the model:
//!
//! * the affine group and bit width, because `mlx-community` publishes one
//!   model at g64/b4 and at g128/b8 and the two pack to identical extents —
//!   no tensor can be asked which it is, and no row may be split four ways to
//!   record it;
//! * whether the expert bank reached the device still in MXFP4, which is a
//!   statement about what the LOADER did and is only knowable after staging;
//! * and the three kernel capabilities, which are facts about
//!   `crates/kernels-metal` as compiled into this binary.
//!
//! [`observed`] takes an [`AffineFormat`](crate::batch::AffineFormat) and a
//! single tensor probe, and that narrowness is the design rather than an
//! economy: **it cannot see a `DecodeGeometry`, so it cannot smuggle a model
//! fact into a binding.** The nine probes that used to decide head norms,
//! fused projections, attention biases, routers, sinks, per-layer scalars and
//! the activation have nowhere to be written down here.
