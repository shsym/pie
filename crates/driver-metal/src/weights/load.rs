//! Loading a checkpoint into something a fire can bind.
//!
//! Two halves existed and nothing called them in sequence.
//! [`compile_load_plan_for`] authors the plan and checks its files;
//! [`stage_plan_weights`] runs it and stages every tensor into one device
//! region. This is the call between them, plus the one conversion that makes
//! the result answer a trace's questions: a [`Handle`](crate::device::Handle) map becomes a
//! [`Slice`] map, which is what [`resolve::Store`] reads.
//!
//! # Why the conversion is not a wrapper for its own sake
//!
//! A `Handle` is a checked view that owns a reference to its buffer; a `Slice`
//! is an address and an extent. The binder takes the second on purpose — see
//! `lowering::executor`'s docs — so that it stays portable and provable with no
//! device in the build. The region is kept beside the map here, because a map
//! of addresses whose buffer has been dropped is a map of dangling pointers.
