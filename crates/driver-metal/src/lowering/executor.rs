//! Binding a lowered launch's operands.
//!
//! `model_compiler::lower` turns a traced fire into rectangles whose operands
//! are [`Arg`]s — an arena offset, a backend-named value, or a weight name.
//! This resolves them. Three rules, stated once, for every family there will
//! ever be: **the driver binds, it does not choose**
//! (`model-compiler/DSL-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! What binding is NOT: dispatch. A bound launch still has to reach the
//! pipeline the compiler built for its symbol, and that is the executor's other
//! half. Splitting them keeps this one pure host logic — provable against a
//! real lowered trace with no GPU in the build.
//!
//! # An operand carries its own extent
//!
//! This is the one place the Metal binder differs from `driver-cuda`'s,
//! and it is deliberate. That one resolves to a bare `*mut c_void` and keeps
//! the arena's size in a neighbouring field, hand-compared at the call site. A
//! pointer whose length lives somewhere else is precisely the boundary this
//! crate exists to remove — see the crate docs and the kernel panics that
//! motivated them.
//!
//! Here every operand is a [`Slice`]: an address **and** what may be addressed
//! from it. A bound arg therefore cannot be passed anywhere without its extent
//! travelling with it, and the arena bound is a property of the value rather
//! than a convention two call sites have to share.
//!
//! It is address-and-extent rather than a `gpu::Handle` so the module stays
//! portable: the binder is host logic and is provable against a real lowered
//! trace with no device in the build. A caller on the device path builds a
//! [`Slice`] from a `Handle`, whose own `slice` has already made the same
//! check.
