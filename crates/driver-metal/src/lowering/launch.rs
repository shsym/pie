//! How a rectangle becomes a launch.
//!
//! A lowered `Launch` gives rows and layers — an **iteration space**. A
//! dispatch needs a thread grid and a threadgroup. Something has to turn one
//! into the other, and *where that something lives* decides whether the
//! executor is a loop or a switch.
//!
//! # The rule is named, and the rule stays a function
//!
//! The obvious move is to put the geometry on the row as numbers, or as a
//! little expression grammar the row can spell in `const`. Both were tried on
//! paper and both are worse than what is here.
//!
//! Numbers cannot work: a kernel's geometry is a function of the fire — rows,
//! widths, head counts — so a row would have to state a formula, not a value.
//!
//! A grammar can express every rule in the driver today; they are all
//! `source → max → min → divide-rounding-up → multiply`. But writing
//! `Term { floor: 1, cap: 1024, div_ceil: 32, mul: 32 }` **loses the sentence
//! that says why**, and in this codebase those sentences are load-bearing:
//! `grid::qmv`'s doc records that its round-up is the difference between
//! computing every output and silently dropping the last few. A grammar buys
//! `const` and pays in explanation.
//!
//! So: the row names a [`Rule`], and the rule remains the documented function
//! it already is. The consequences are the point —
//!
//! * **The driver's dispatch is a loop.** `sig.launch.eval(dims)` for every
//!   launch, with no per-family branch and no per-kernel arm.
//! * **The match is arm-per-RULE, not arm-per-kernel.** Sixteen arms, shared by
//!   every family, every text and every backend that reuses the vocabulary. A
//!   new kernel that launches like an existing one costs zero arms — it names
//!   the rule.
//! * **Every doc comment survives**, beside the code it explains, which is
//!   where this project keeps its arguments.
//!
//! # Where this belongs
//!
//! On [`KernelSig`], as `launch = Rule::Qmv` beside `whole`, `needs` and
//! `lacks` — a launch shape is a contract fact exactly as those are. It is
//! here rather than in `kernels` because the vocabulary had to be shown to
//! cover the existing rules before the tables adopt it, and the test below is
//! that proof: **every rule the driver hand-writes today is reproduced through
//! this enum, exactly.**
//!
