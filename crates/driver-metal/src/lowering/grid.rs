//! The launch arithmetic: what a kernel's `[[thread_position_in_grid]]`
//! contract says its grid must be.
//!
//! **This is the half of the retiring `batch/dispatch.rs` that stays.** That file is on the
//! retirement list because it also builds a decode DAG out of a
//! `DecodeGeometry` — a model definition inside the driver. The shapes below
//! are the opposite kind of fact: they are the KERNEL's knowledge, read off
//! each shader's thread-position contract, and no generic executor can do
//! without them. Moving them here is what lets the DAG builder be deleted
//! without taking them along.
//!
//! Nothing here is a decision. When a caller needs one — which tile, whether
//! to batch — that reads `Tuning` and arrives as an argument. Each helper's
//! doc names the kernel whose contract it states, and several of those
//! sentences are load-bearing findings rather than description: [`qmv`]'s
//! round-up records the difference between computing every output and
//! silently dropping the last few.
//!
//! [`crate::lowering::launch`] is what turns a stated [`Rule`] into one of these.
