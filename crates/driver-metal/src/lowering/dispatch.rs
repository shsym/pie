//! Turning a lowered fire into dispatches. The executor's other half.
//!
//! [`executor`] resolves a launch's operands to addresses; [`geometry`] turns
//! a rectangle into a thread grid. This is the walk that uses both, and its
//! whole shape is the claim the crate rests on:
//!
//! ```text
//! for launch in &lowered.launches {
//!     let sig  = sig_in(KERNELS, symbol)?;   // the row states the contract
//!     let args = bind(lowered, launch, ..)?; // the driver resolves names
//!     let grid = eval(sig.launch, dims)?;    // the row names the rule
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! **There is no per-family branch and no per-kernel arm.** A symbol is a
//! name: on this backend an entry point is compiled from one, so a text that
//! states a symbol the table knows needs no code written to receive it. That
//! is the difference the north star measures — `driver-cuda`'s executor
//! grows an arm per kernel "beside the bridge", and this one does not grow at
//! all.
//!
//! # Portable, and that is deliberate
//!
//! Nothing here touches a Metal object. A dispatch is a symbol, a file, a
//! grid, a threadgroup and a list of resolved operands — all of which are
//! decided before any device is involved, and all of which are therefore
//! provable in a build with no GPU. `encode` is the half that needs one.
//!
