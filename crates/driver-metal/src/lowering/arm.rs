//! What a statement supplies a routine, per routine.
//!
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §7 Stage 4, and §6's *"the `operands`
//! column, as code"*. A routine's signature says what it takes and in what
//! order; it does not say where any of it comes from. That is a fact about the
//! STATEMENT — the third input, the second weight, the fire's position table,
//! the layer's KV pages — and an arm is where it is written.
//!
//! # Why this is a function per routine and not a table
//!
//! It was a table. `KernelSig::operands` is that table, and the whole of
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §8a is the class of defect it admits:
//! a row states a `Source` for every slot, the slots are positional, and a
//! row that names one too few or one too many binds every argument after it
//! one place off. Nothing checks a row against the kernel it describes,
//! because a row is data and the kernel is a shader in another language.
//!
//! An arm is a CALL. It hands its values to a `pub fn` whose parameters have
//! types and names, so an argument list one short does not compile. That is
//! the trade the refactor makes: the same information, moved from a place
//! where only a device could disagree with it to a place where the compiler
//! does.
//!
//! # What an arm may not do
//!
//! Compute a grid. Every arm here is operand plumbing and nothing else: the
//! numbers a launch is built from reach the routine as arguments and the
//! routine states its own rectangle. An arm that did arithmetic would put the
//! second opinion back — see `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §6, *"the
//! QMM tile is chosen in `model/` and again in `launch.rs`, compared
//! nowhere"*.
