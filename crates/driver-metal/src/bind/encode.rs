//! Encoding dispatches onto the GPU. The one half that needs a device.
//!
//! [`dispatch::plan`] decided everything: which entry point, which shader,
//! which grid, which addresses. What is left is three calls per launch — set
//! the pipeline, bind the operands, dispatch — and one compile pass in front
//! of them.
//!
//! # A symbol is a name, and that is the whole argument
//!
//! `Compiler::compile_batch` builds a pipeline from `(path, entry name)`. So
//! every symbol a text states reaches the GPU through the *same* three lines,
//! and adding a kernel to a text costs no code here. That is what
//! `driver-cuda`'s executor cannot do: a CUDA launcher is an authored C++
//! function, so its bridge grows an arm per kernel.
