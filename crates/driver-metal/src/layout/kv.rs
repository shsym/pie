//! The paged KV pool, sized by the fire's geometry rather than by a model.
//!
//! # What was already here
//!
//! `gpu::weights::stage` allocates `KvSlots { k_pages, v_pages }` per
//! full-attention layer, and has since the port. The pool is not missing — what
//! was missing is a pool whose SIZE comes from numbers a text states rather
//! than from `batch::DecodeGeometry`, which is a model definition inside the
//! driver and is on the retirement list.
//!
//! So this is not a re-port. It is the same allocation with its arguments
//! taken from the frame instead: layers, kv heads, head dim, page size, pages.
//! Every one of those is either the fire's geometry (which the caller already
//! hands the executor) or the ABI's own (`DeviceFacts::page_size`).
//!
//! # Page-major, one stride everywhere
//!
//! `layout::kv_move`'s plan already assumes it, and says so: *"one plan serves
//! every buffer — the same `(src, dst, bytes)` offsets apply to the K pages
//! and the V pages of every full-attention layer, because the pool is
//! page-major `[page, row]` at one stride everywhere."* This lays the pool out
//! that way, which is what makes that plan true rather than hopeful.
//!
//! # Why the allocation is next door
//!
//! [`Shape`] is arithmetic over nine `u32`s and is correct without a GPU;
//! `Pool` is memory and is not. Rule 2 of `.wiki/driver/north-star.md` cuts
//! on exactly that question, so the allocated half lives in `kv::pool` behind
//! the one gate and this file stays portable. (Both spellings are plain code
//! rather than doc links on purpose: a link from the portable half to the
//! gated one does not resolve in the build this split exists to allow.)
//!
//! It is not a tidiness split. `lowering::resolve` — host logic, tested with no
//! device — holds a `Shape` to answer the KV strides, so while the two shared
//! one Apple gate the crate did not compile off-Apple at all, and every job
//! in the tree builds it with that gate true. `tests/portable_half.rs` is what
//! now says so.
