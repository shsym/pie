//! What a compiled program is: the executables the three launch paths share.
//!
//! [`compile`](super::Runtime::compile) produces one [`ProgramExecutable`] per
//! program; the M1 singleton path dispatches its [`RegionExecutable`]s, the M2
//! fused path its [`FusedExecutable`]s, and the M3 grouped path its
//! [`GroupedExecutable`]s. A [`StageExecutable`] is shared between programs
//! through the stage cache, which is why a [`ProgramStage`] holds it behind an
//! [`Rc`] beside this program's own copy of the plan.
//!
//! Two C++ habits do not survive the port:
//!
//! * **A capability and its excuse lived in four fields.** `fused_supported`,
//!   `fused_reason` and `fused_regions` (and the same trio for grouped) could
//!   disagree — supported with a reason, unsupported with regions. Here each
//!   is one `Result`: the regions when the path exists, the reason when it
//!   does not, and no third state.
//! * **`int ordinal = -1` sentinels.** An executable that exists has its
//!   ordinals; the `-1` existed because C++ aggregates need a default. The
//!   fields here are `u32` and a half-built executable is not a value.
