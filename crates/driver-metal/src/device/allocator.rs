//! A pool of short-lived buffers, recycled instead of reallocated.
//!
//! # Why these do not come out of the heap
//!
//! [`Heap`](crate::device::heap::Heap) is a bump allocator: it hands out placements
//! in order and never takes one back. That is right for the weights and the
//! KV cache, which live as long as the model does, and wrong for the buffers
//! a step needs for the length of one forward pass -- a scratch reduction, a
//! staged set of arguments, a scatter index. Those recur every token, and a
//! bump allocator asked for them runs out.
//!
//! # Why they are not just allocated per step either
//!
//! `newBufferWithLength:` is a device allocation, and every one of them has
//! to be added to the residency set, which then has to be committed. On the
//! measured trace that pair cost 0.375 ms out of a 1.2 ms gap between two
//! forward passes -- for buffers a few hundred bytes wide. So they are kept.
//!
//! # Recycling is not optional here, it is automatic
//!
//! The C++ shell keys an `in_use` flag by raw pointer, because a `void*` can
//! be recycled twice, or never. Neither is expressible here: [`Transient`]
//! owns its buffer and returns it to the pool when it is dropped. Recycling
//! twice does not compile, and forgetting to recycle is not a leak.
//!
//! What that does NOT change is the hazard it shares with the C++: a buffer
//! is reusable the moment the host is done with it, and the host is done with
//! it before the GPU is. Dropping a [`Transient`] whose step has not signalled
//! hands the next step a buffer the previous one is still reading. The pool
//! cannot see that; the step boundary is what enforces it.
//!
//! # Size classes, and why the cache depth is not flat
//!
//! Powers of two from 256 bytes, so a pass that asks for 300 bytes and then
//! 400 gets the same buffer. The per-class cache depth is derived from the
//! class rather than fixed: one measured pass acquires about thirteen buffers
//! and most land in the smallest classes, so a flat depth of eight overflowed
//! on every pass -- and the overflow path is the expensive one, releasing a
//! buffer and re-allocating it next time. The byte budget is what actually
//! bounds the pool; the depth only stops one class hoarding it.
