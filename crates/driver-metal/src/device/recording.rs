//! A fire, recorded once.
//!
//! `encode` walks the dispatch list every step: a pipeline set, a bind per
//! operand, an argument-table set and a dispatch, then a barrier. Measured on
//! `qwen3_0_6b` — 424 dispatches, 3 779 address binds, about 5 000
//! Objective-C messages, **14.8 ms**, which is 47.5 % of a prefill and
//! **76.4 % of a decode**. And it is the same 14.8 ms every step, because the
//! loop is proportional to the dispatch count and the dispatch count is a
//! property of the text rather than of the batch.
//!
//! This records that walk into an [`MTLIndirectCommandBuffer`] instead, so a
//! fire costs one `executeCommandsInBuffer` on the host.
//!
//! # What makes it replayable
//!
//! Only three things differ between two fires of one `(plan, row shape)` —
//! the arena, the params and the fire tables — and `gpu::fire::Scratch` pools all
//! three, so their addresses are the previous fire's. Everything else (the
//! dispatch order, the ten pipelines, the twelve grids, the weight addresses)
//! was already stable. See `.wiki/driver/graph-metal.md` §4.
//!
//! # The three preconditions, each of which fails badly
//!
//! Learned from `tests/device_icb.rs`, and none of them is documented by
//! Apple in a place this tree would have found:
//!
//! 1. **Pipelines must be compiled `supportIndirectCommandBuffers`.** Setting
//!    one that was not **faults** — SIGSEGV inside the recording loop, before
//!    anything executes. `Compiler` states it for every pipeline.
//! 2. **The command type must match the dispatch call.** Declaring
//!    `ConcurrentDispatch` and calling `concurrentDispatchThreads` is
//!    **silent**: the command does nothing.
//! 3. **The ICB must itself be resident**, because it is a buffer the GPU
//!    reads its commands out of.
