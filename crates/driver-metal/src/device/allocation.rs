//! A standalone device buffer that leaves the residency set when it dies.
//!
//! # The leak this replaces
//!
//! `ring::allocate` created a shared-storage buffer, added it to the
//! context's residency set — `addAllocation`, `commit`, `requestResidency` —
//! and returned a [`Handle`]. A `Handle` is a *view*: it is handed out for
//! heap slots and sub-ranges as well as for whole allocations, so a `Drop`
//! on it that removed the allocation would remove one the caller does not
//! own. Nothing else removed it either. Measured: fifty allocate-then-drop
//! cycles left the residency set holding **fifty allocations and 52 MB**.
//!
//! A residency set holds its own reference, so a buffer that is only dropped
//! stays alive and stays resident. That is the same defect
//! `.wiki/driver/progress-metal.md` records for the caching pool under *"a
//! count is not a release"*, in the one place where nothing counted at all.
//!
//! # Why a type rather than a `release` call
//!
//! Because a `release` call is a convention, and this crate has already paid
//! for that one twice — the pool's `State::release` that decremented counters
//! and edited nothing, and the C++ `release_standalone_buffer` whose whole
//! reason for existing is that `create_standalone_buffer` handed back
//! something with no owner. `.wiki/driver/real-metal-north-star.md` §8 states
//! the target directly: *registration and release are one type's construct
//! and drop*.
//!
//! The pattern is not new here. [`Mapped`](super::external::Mapped),
//! [`External`](super::external::External) and [`Ring`](super::ring::Ring)
//! all register on construct and remove on `Drop`. Bare `allocate` was the
//! one primitive that could not, and every caller of it leaked.
//!
//! # What ownership now means
//!
//! An `Allocation` is resident for exactly as long as it lives, so **dropping
//! one while the GPU is still reading it is now a real event** where before
//! it was free. That is not a regression introduced by this type — it is the
//! bug it makes visible. It found one: the serving seam staged a fire's
//! tables per step and dropped them at the end of the loop iteration, while
//! the fire itself was not waited for until after the loop. Under the leak
//! that was invisible and permanent; the fix is that the tables travel with
//! the fire, which is what [`InFlight`](crate::fire::run::InFlight)
//! already did for the argument table and the scalars.
//!
//! [`Deref`](std::ops::Deref) to `Handle` is deliberate and follows
//! [`Lease`](crate::fire::scratch::Lease), which is the same shape one
//! layer up: a thing that owns a region and should read like the region.
