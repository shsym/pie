//! What the machine will actually give, as a snapshot rather than a question.
//!
//! Two ceilings bound a model, and they are not the same question.
//!
//! `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` is a DEVICE property: on Apple silicon it
//! is a flat fraction of installed RAM and never moves. It reports the same
//! number to the first model of the day and to one starting on a box where
//! twenty gigabytes are already spoken for. Under unified memory that second
//! case is the one that fails.
//!
//! [`Memory::reclaimable`] is the other ceiling -- what the kernel can hand
//! back right now without swapping. It counts free, purgeable and evictable
//! pages and deliberately excludes wired ones, because wired pages cannot be
//! paged out and neither can memory a GPU context has already committed. That
//! exclusion is the point rather than an omission: a wedged context's pages
//! are charged to no live process and appear in no process listing, so the
//! only way to see them is to ask what is LEFT rather than what is used.
//!
//! # Why wired bytes are worth reporting at all
//!
//! They are the tell for a leaked GPU context, and the failure they precede
//! is not a slow machine. The window server cannot get memory to composite a
//! frame, blocks in the kernel on its own submit, misses its 120-second
//! watchdog, and takes the desktop down with it. The C++ shell records that
//! happening twice, once ten hours after the run that caused it.
//!
//! # A snapshot, not four static functions
//!
//! The C++ spells these as statics that reach the machine on every call, so
//! testing a refusal that only fires on a device the models do not fit needs
//! a process-wide override for each one -- and then a fifth predicate,
//! `device_working_set_is_forced`, because a forced working set paired with
//! the real machine's free memory compares two unrelated worlds and makes the
//! answer depend on whatever else is running.
//!
//! A snapshot has none of that. [`Memory::probe`] reads the machine once;
//! any other `Memory` is a struct literal. There is no hook to install, no
//! hook to forget to remove, and no way to build half an imaginary machine,
//! so the fifth predicate has nothing to warn about and does not exist.
