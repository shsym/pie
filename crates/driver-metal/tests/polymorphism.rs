//! Does the Metal text state a polymorphic program? Measured, not assumed.
//!
//! tart's claim is that concurrent requests running **structurally different
//! programs** merge into one supergraph, so operators they share execute
//! exactly once (`.wiki/tart/README.md`). The mechanism is in the lowering and
//! is backend-neutral: `lower` takes `&[Row]`, a `Row` is a request's feature
//! point (`depth_k`, `lora`, `multi_token`, `custom_mask`, `hooked`,
//! `wants_scores`, `samples`), and a `Launch` covers a **row range** — so rows
//! sharing an operator share one rectangle and rows that differ get their own.
//!
//! Having the mechanism is not the same as using it: a text has to state
//! guards on those axes. This file used to record that the Metal text stated
//! **none** — every launch covering the whole fire, on every row set
//! tried, including sets the CUDA lowering refuses outright.
//!
//! **That changed when the text declared its depth axis.** `m.depth_window()`
//! makes every layer-tagged statement implicitly `rows(depth > layer)`, and
//! this file now asserts what that buys and what it costs:
//!
//! * rows truncating at different layers produce **narrowing rectangles**
//!   rather than one rectangle per op — the shared prefix executes once, which
//!   is the supergraph claim. Measured when it landed: row-work 2936 → 1688,
//!   −42%, at an unchanged launch count;
//! * and the text now imposes the **seriation contract**, refusing a row order
//!   whose depth runs are not contiguous with `Discontiguous { axis: "depth" }`
//!   — the same refusal the CUDA text makes, and the reason the frame bridge
//!   has to hand rows over in seriated order.
//!
//! The axes still unstated are `lora`, `custom_mask` and `hooked`; the last two
//! need `RowPred`'s partitions, which need seams this backend does not have
//! yet. Each is asserted below as unstated, so landing one fails here.
