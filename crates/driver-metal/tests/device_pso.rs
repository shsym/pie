//! Who owns a pipeline, and which GPU its binary is valid on.
//!
//! Two claims, both about things the C++ shell needs machinery for and this
//! crate does not.
//!
//! The first is ownership. `RawMetalContext` keeps every pipeline it built in
//! an `NSMutableArray` plus a parallel `unordered_set<void*>`, and exposes
//! `release_pso` and `retained_pso_count` so a caller can give one back and a
//! test can check the two containers stayed in step. All of that exists
//! because the pipeline crosses an FFI boundary as a bare `void*`, which owns
//! nothing. Here it is a `Retained`, so the test to write is not "does the
//! count go down" but "is there a second owner at all" -- and the answer must
//! be no.
//!
//! The second is identity: [`Context::cache_id`] must actually distinguish
//! GPUs, and must be stable within a run, because it is what keeps one
//! device's compiled binaries out of another's cache.
