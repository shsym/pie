//! Layers point down.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `.wiki/driver/real-metal-north-star.md` §9 asks for a tree with a
//! direction, and the tree had two cycles instead:
//!
//! * `device/recording.rs` imported `lowering::dispatch::Dispatch` while
//!   `fire/run.rs` imported `Recordings`. The ICB path knew what a fire
//!   was, so recording could not be understood, tested or replaced without
//!   the model layer in scope.
//! * `device/ring.rs` imported `program/channel.rs` while ten files
//!   under `program/` imported `device/`. That one was worse for
//!   reading badly: `channel.rs` is `pub use driver::*` and nothing else, so
//!   the arrow pointed at an external crate's ABI and *looked* like a
//!   dependency on the shader compiler.
//!
//! Both are gone — `Command` for the first, moving `channel` to the crate
//! root for the second. This test is what keeps them gone. A direction that
//! is only written down is restored by whoever next needs one symbol from
//! one layer up, and the `use` line that does it is two words in a diff.
//!
//! # What it does not check
//!
//! Cycles in general. This names ONE edge — out of `device/`, upward —
//! because that is the edge the crate has actually paid for twice, and a
//! general cycle detector over `use` lines is a resolver, which is the
//! compiler's job. If a third layer starts costing something, add its rule
//! here rather than generalising this one into something nobody reads.
//!
//! # Why it is not gated
//!
//! It reads files. `device/*.rs` is on disk whether or not `metal-4`
//! compiles it, so this runs in the portable half too and the no-GPU CI job
//! catches a re-introduced cycle without a Mac. That is the same reason it
//! is absent from the `required-features` list in `Cargo.toml`: absence is
//! this crate's claim that a target needs no device, and this one does not.
