//! Every field of the geometry is filled by something, or says what.
//!
//! `DecodeGeometry` is what the whole driver reads a fire's shape off.
//! `geometry_from_deployment` fills the half a catalog row states; its
//! doc says the caller fills the rest — "the capacity fields
//! (`max_tokens`, `max_requests`, `max_slots`, the paging trio) because
//! those are the OPERATOR's numbers ... and `alt_quant`/`mxfp4_experts`
//! because those are solved from the staged tensors".
//!
//! That sentence was a plan, not a description, and it has now failed
//! at both of the fields it named. `alt_quant`'s half was false about
//! the load plan — `QuantSpec` had the answer per tensor the whole
//! time. `mxfp4_experts`'s half was false about ITSELF: it promised a
//! fact "solved from the staged tensors" on a struct whose constructor
//! is handed a deployment, a load shape and an affine point, and never
//! a tensor. It was gone with the promise.
//!
//! Two fields had already gone the whole way: `mrope_section` and
//! `norm_topk_prob` were declared, defaulted, and read by nobody at all,
//! and the second one MATTERED — the routing denominator it named
//! reaches a Metal shader as a word of `RouterParams`, stated by the
//! row, and would have been silently answered here if anything had
//! thought to look.
//!
//! So this holds the struct to a rule with two halves: a field is
//! STATED by `geometry_from_deployment`, or it is named below with what
//! fills it and when — AND a field is READ by something in this crate,
//! or named as unread.
//!
//! The second half is not the first one twice. Five fields passed the
//! first and failed the second: `final_logit_softcap`,
//! `attention_k_eq_v`, `per_layer_emb_dim`, and the
//! `swiglu_limit`/`swiglu_alpha` pair were each filled correctly from a
//! `Deployment` and read by nobody, because the quantity they name
//! reaches the Metal text by a DIFFERENT road — `LlamaLikeMetalFacts`
//! carries `logit_softcap`, `v_from_k`, `per_layer_emb_dim` and
//! `Activation::SwiGlu { limit, alpha }`, and the text reads those. Two
//! readings of one quantity, with only one of them live: the same shape
//! as the deployment/trace seam and the `MetalRow` merge. They are
//! deleted, and this test is why the next one cannot arrive quietly.
