//! Compiling from several threads at once.
//!
//! This test asserts nothing. It is here because without the gate in
//! `pipeline.rs` it aborts -- not with a failed assertion but with a trap
//! inside `libsystem_malloc`, because concurrent pipeline creation on this
//! driver corrupts the process heap.
//!
//! The churn after the compile is the load-bearing half. Corruption during
//! the compile is invisible to a process that then exits; it surfaces the
//! next time something walks the damaged freelist. Removing the churn takes
//! the failure rate from three runs in six to none, while changing nothing
//! about the damage.
