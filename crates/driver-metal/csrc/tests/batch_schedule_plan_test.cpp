// Phase 3 (metal_ptir_plan.md §7) batch-scheduler gate — pure host unit test,
// no Metal/Apple/checkpoint dependency (`plan_batch_execution` is defined
// outside the `#if defined(__APPLE__)` split in batch/forward.cpp, so this binary
// always builds and runs on every platform).
//
// A launch batch of forward-needing members shares the ONE M=1 KV ring. The
// scheduler decides which members the single-ring serial path can serve and in
// what order:
//   * the (at most one) member that CONTINUES the currently ring-backed
//     sequence runs first (before any fresh member clobbers the ring);
//   * every fresh member (reset+replay from position 0) is always serviceable
//     and runs after the leading continuation, in input order;
//   * a continuation of a NON-ring-backed sequence, a 2nd continuation, or an
//     explicit per-token KV write descriptor is honestly gated (needs the
//     per-request paged-KV path when exercising the legacy M=1 planner) — marked not-ok
//     with a precise reason instead of silently corrupting ring state.
