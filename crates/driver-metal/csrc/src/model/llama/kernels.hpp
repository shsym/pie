/// The llama families' kernel PSOs and launch geometry.
///
/// This file is short, and that is the finding rather than an omission. The
/// shared decode table in `kernels/decode_psos.cpp` already carries every
/// dispatch a dense llama layer makes -- embedding, rms, the affine matvec,
/// rope, kv-append, sdpa, silu-mul, residual-add, argmax -- because the shared
/// `Kernel` enum's common prefix IS a llama decoder. Adding the family needed
/// no new dense kernel at all.
///
/// What it did need is three things the shared table has no reason to carry:
///
///   * a 128-wide attention head. `sdpa_vector` and `sdpa_paged` are templated
///     on D and were instantiated at 256 (qwen3.5), 512 (gemma4 full) and 64
///     (gpt-oss). Llama and every Qwen use 128, so that is one instantiation
///     each, not a kernel.
///   * `row_gather`, for the prefill tail.
///   * the routed FFN, built from the generic `moe_route.metal` kernels and
///     the unbiased routed matvec (`qmv_gptoss_impl` with BIASED off).
///
/// Notably NOT borrowed: `gptoss_swiglu`. That kernel bakes in gpt-oss's
/// asymmetric clamp, its `alpha`, and its `(up + 1)` term. Qwen3-MoE uses plain
/// SwiGLU, so the routed path uses the ordinary `silu_mul` over the whole
/// [rows, k, width] expert stack.
