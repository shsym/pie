// Per-device tuning constants.
//
// Every crossover in this driver was measured on one machine -- an M1 Max --
// and then written down as a `constexpr`. That was honest while there was one
// machine. On an M4 Pro the same constants are wrong in the direction that
// costs the most: the GEMM crossover sits three rows too high, so the batches
// where the GEMM already wins are still served by the GEMV.
//
// The rule this file exists to keep: a DEFAULT-CONSTRUCTED `DeviceTuning`
// reproduces the M1 numbers EXACTLY. Adding a device may never change what an
// unrecognised one does, and a machine this file has never heard of gets the
// constants that were measured rather than an extrapolation. Overrides are
// per-generation and each carries the measurement that justifies it.
//
// `benches/tune_device.py` takes that measurement. Every field below has a
// `PIE_METAL_*` override so it can be swept without a rebuild, and the script
// finds, for each one, a batch where its candidate values provably choose
// DIFFERENT paths -- which is not a detail. A threshold does nothing at
// batches that do not straddle it, so sweeping one anywhere else times the
// same work twice and reports the reassuring answer.

    ///     repair, and it is 8% WORSE. The registers cost more than the
