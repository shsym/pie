/// A decode engine for a model family with no recurrent state.
///
/// `MetalExecutor::Impl` is qwen3.5's: its state is `DecodeGeometry`, that
/// family's `Dispatch`, `ScratchSchedule` and `BoundDecode`, plus GDN conv and
/// recurrent slots and the ping-pong that advances them. gemma4 and gpt-oss
/// share none of that, and both are the same simpler shape:
///
///   * one DAG, one activation pool, per-layer KV;
///   * no state to carry between tokens beyond the KV itself, so a fresh
///     sequence is a memset and nothing else.
///
/// So this is not a second executor. It is the family-shaped part of one, and
/// `Impl` keeps everything that is not family-shaped: the context, the logits
/// staging, the sequence bookkeeping.
///
/// Both families are PAGED, so several sequences are resident at once, each
/// attending its own page list. They differ in what a multi-row fire COSTS.
///
/// gemma4 has an M>1 path: one schedule serves decode and prefill, and a fire
/// of R rows is one wider launch. `gemma4_prefill_numerics_test` measures that
/// a decode step is a fire of one row and lands exactly where firing the whole
/// prompt at once does, which is what lets one schedule do both.
///
/// gpt-oss does not, and will not soon: its MoE picks experts per ROW, so a
/// batched routed matmul is a different kernel rather than a wider launch. A
/// fire of R rows is R PASSES, each a full DAG at M=1. It is correct and it
/// batches nothing, so concurrency costs it throughput rather than buying any
/// -- `max_rows()` is a time budget there and a memory one for gemma4.
