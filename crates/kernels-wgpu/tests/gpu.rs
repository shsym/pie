//! What a module has to survive before a device is even asked for, and then
//! what it RETURNS when one is.
//!
//! `naga` is a Rust WGSL front end and it ships inside `wgpu`, so the thing
//! that turns a `.wgsl` into a pipeline can be called from a `#[test]` on a
//! machine with no adapter at all. That is this backend's one structural
//! advantage over its siblings -- `kernels-vulkan` needs `glslc` to learn the
//! same thing -- and it is worth spending: `source::tests::
//! every_declared_variant_expands` proves the directives resolve, and this
//! proves the WGSL they resolve to is WGSL.
//!
//! # The half of this file that needs a device
//!
//! Everything above `// The device half` is structural and runs anywhere.
//! Everything below it dispatches a real entrypoint against a real adapter and
//! compares what comes back with a scalar reference. A parse and a validation
//! prove a module is one a device would ACCEPT; they say nothing whatsoever
//! about the number it produces, and `.wiki/new-driver/wgpu.md` §7 is the
//! record of 52 green tests that proved exactly that much and no more.
//!
//! The five rules the device half is written to are `kernels-vulkan`'s, and
//! each one is a defect somebody already paid for:
//!
//! 1. **The reference is computed from the same bf16 the device was given.**
//!    [`pack`] returns both the bytes and the widened values, so a reference
//!    built from the original `f32` is not spellable here. Comparing against
//!    the `f32` folds the input's own rounding into the tolerance and quietly
//!    widens it by a bf16 ulp per operand.
//! 2. **The tolerance scales by the ROW's own largest magnitude**, not by
//!    `max(|want|, 1.0)`. That floor of one turned a 2% claim into a flat
//!    absolute 0.02, which is 7% of an attention value and 16% of a router
//!    weight. See [`agrees`].
//! 3. **Every size is ragged.** 13 rows of 460, a 461-wide bias, 11 keys, 7
//!    experts, a page size of 3. `.wiki/new-driver/vulkan.md` §12 is the whole
//!    lesson: three pointwise tests there ran at n = 512 against a 256-wide
//!    workgroup and two GEMV tests at 16 rows against a kernel covering 8, so
//!    the last partial group never existed and `div_ceil` and plain division
//!    were the same expression. `every_grid_here_is_ragged` holds every extent
//!    this file dispatches against its workgroup and asserts the division is
//!    inexact, so swapping [`over`]'s `div_ceil` for `/` fails.
//! 4. **Every check is confirmed to FAIL when its reference is perturbed.**
//!    [`agrees`] returns an `Err` rather than panicking so that each test can
//!    run its own control on its own device answer through
//!    [`refuses_a_perturbed_reference`]. A test that has never failed has not
//!    been shown to test anything.
//! 5. **Every layout comes from the KERNEL's own statement of itself.** [`run`]
//!    builds its bind group layout from the ROUTINE's signature and refuses a
//!    buffer list that is not as long as the signature's buffer run; [`Block`]
//!    writes uniform fields BY NAME at the offsets the SHADER's own
//!    `@group(1)` struct puts them at ([`block_of_shader`]) and refuses to
//!    finish with a field unwritten. Both sides used to be read off the row,
//!    and the row is gone; a signature the compiler checks and a struct
//!    `naga` parses are the two things it was describing.
//!
//! ## Two things that are this backend's alone
//!
//! **bf16 crosses as `array<u32>`, two values per word, low half first.** So a
//! bf16 pointwise kernel's x-extent is in WORDS, which is half the element
//! count, and every grid below that looks half the size it should be is that.
//! A host that copies Metal's or Vulkan's element extents overshoots by 2x --
//! harmless, because every pointwise body guards on `arrayLength(&out_)` --
//! but a host that then halves the wrong quantity undershoots, and an
//! undershot grid writes nothing, reads back as the zeros the buffer was born
//! with, and completes successfully.
//!
//! **`dispatch_workgroups` counts WORKGROUPS**, where Metal's
//! `dispatchThreads` counts threads. Every grid here is therefore divided by
//! the module's own `@workgroup_size`, rounded UP, and the rounding is what
//! `every_grid_here_is_ragged` pins.
//!
//! ## Why none of these is `#[ignore]`
//!
//! An ignored test is one nobody runs, including on the machine that has the
//! hardware. There is no `native` feature here to gate them with either --
//! this crate has no build product -- so a test that needs an adapter and
//! finds none prints why and returns. A build box stays green; a machine with
//! a GPU is asked the real question.
//!
//! # What this file found, and what it did not
//!
//! `a_bias_is_broadcast_down_every_row_at_an_odd_width` was red on every
//! adapter it ran on before `kernels/norm/add_bias.wgsl` was rewritten to own
//! a WORD rather than a column pair. It is green now, and swapping the two
//! halves at the pack makes it red again, so the repair is load-bearing.
//!
//! What it did NOT find, recorded because the distinction matters for how the
//! rest of this file should be read: removing that body's single-writer guard
//! does not fail it. `biased` derives each half's column from its own element
//! index, so both writers of a straddling word compute identical bytes. The
//! guard buys that the write is not a RACE — a memory-model property, which no
//! comparison against a reference can see. A test says what a device returned;
//! it does not say the return was well-defined.
//!
//! # How much of the table this file answers for
//!
//! `every_stated_row_is_dispatched_or_named` is the assertion, and [`COVERAGE`]
//! is the list it holds. All 44 STATED rows are dispatched; the other 56 carry
//! axes and a name and no operands, so no layout can be derived from them and
//! [`run`] cannot bind one. The count is pinned in both directions — the list
//! must be exactly the table's stated set, every name in it must still appear
//! in this file, and [`run`] refuses to dispatch a row the list does not claim
//! — so the number shrinking is a failure rather than a silence.
//!
//! **The 56 are not unreachable, only underivable, and that distinction cost
//! this file its most important kernel.** `driver-wgpu` runs them constantly.
//! The retired `binding::reorder` fell back to the TRACE's argument order when
//! a row stated none — `affine_qmm_t`, `sdpa_paged_tiled` and `gdn_core` were
//! in that set, "most of what a model runs", as that function's own doc said —
//! and an ARM asks for those operands by name now, so the order is stated
//! rather than fallen back to.
//! Reading "this harness cannot bind one" as "so it is not proven here" is how
//! `sdpa_paged_tiled` — the arm every multi-row fire takes, which is most of a
//! serving deployment's — went unproven while the decode arm beside it had a
//! thorough one. [`dispatch`] is `run` without the row: the order stated from
//! the shader's own `@group(0)` declarations. It proves the SHADER and not the
//! driver's ordering, and it is the strongest claim an unstated row admits.

/// * The VALIDATOR adds the module-level rules the parser does not see: two
///   `var`s on one `@group`/`@binding` pair, a uniform member at an offset its
///   type may not sit at, an entry point whose resources do not resolve.

/// VALIDATOR is what proves it is a WGSL a device would accept.

/// The gap was not hypothetical. `common/bf16.inc.wgsl` was first written with
///
/// ```wgsl
/// fn pie_load_bf16(words: ptr<storage, array<u32>, read>, i: u32) -> f32
/// ```
///
/// which parses cleanly and is not legal WGSL: core WGSL allows a pointer
/// parameter only in the `function`, `private` and `workgroup` address spaces,
/// and `ptr<storage, ...>` needs the `unrestricted_pointer_parameters` language
/// extension that `naga` refuses and no WebGPU implementation owes anyone. Four
/// of the five family tests were green. **478 of the 480 modules failed here**,
/// and every one of them would have failed at `create_shader_module` on the
/// first fire.
///
/// So this runs over the whole tree, and it is the check to add to rather than
/// the ones above.
///
/// ## Why `Capabilities::all()`
///
/// The point of this test is the LANGUAGE, not the device: a body that needs a
/// capability should fail where the capability is asked for, which is
/// `Capability::requires()` and the tier that names it. Validating with an
/// empty capability set would fold two different failures — "this is not WGSL"
/// and "this adapter cannot run it" — into one message.

/// The second question is checked separately and it matters just as much: see

/// the host scan it replaces", that a value tie keeps the LOWEST index, and
/// that `eos_flag` is set when the winner is a stop token. Until now the only
/// evidence for any of them was that the module parses and validates.
///
/// The tie rule is the one that matters and the one a reduction gets wrong.
/// Logits are bf16 — eight bits of mantissa — over a vocabulary of a hundred
/// and fifty thousand, so exact ties are not a corner case, they are Tuesday.
/// A tree that keeps "whichever index the schedule reduced last" answers a
/// different token from the host scan on those, and both answers look like a
/// plausible model. Every determinism claim in this repository sits on top of
/// that: `beam-search-greedy-identity`,
/// `greedy-decoding-is-the-same-alone-and-in-a-crowd` and the two
/// `*-identity` inferlets all assert that two paths pick the SAME token.
///
/// # How the ties are made, and why they are not an accident
///
/// The winning value is placed at four indices, in different LANE STRIPES —
/// the loop strides by 256, so index `i` belongs to lane `i % 256`. Two ties
/// inside one lane exercise the `>` in the scan; two across lanes exercise the
/// `(ov == sh_v[lid] && oi < sh_i[lid])` in the tree. Only the lowest of the
/// four may be returned.
///
/// Row 1 starts at an ODD offset (the vocabulary is odd), which is the other
/// thing the body is careful about: two bf16 logits share a `u32`, so the half
/// a row starts on is `(base + i) & 1` and not `i & 1`. A body that used `i`
/// reads every logit of row 1 shifted by one half-word.
///
/// The row is UNSTATED, so [`dispatch`] states the binding order the shader
/// declares: logits 0, next_token 1, params 2, eos_flag 3, with `vocab` and
/// `n_eos` inside the params BUFFER rather than a uniform block.

///
/// # And offered is not usable, so this asks that too
///
/// A feature bit an adapter advertises still has to survive `request_device`.
/// This one is gated TWICE: naming `EXPERIMENTAL_COOPERATIVE_MATRIX` is

/// a device opens. The path is open in the sense that matters, and its price
/// is that second signature rather than a wgpu release.
///
/// Needs an adapter; prints and asserts nothing about the answer, because
/// either answer is a fact about the machine rather than about the tree.
///
/// # The rest of that backend, since it is a reference for what is open here
///
/// `ggml/src/ggml-webgpu/wgsl-shaders/` is 44 WGSL files solving this exact
/// problem, and four of them are the leads this tree has already written down

///
/// * `flash_attn_vec_split.wgsl` + `flash_attn_vec_reduce.wgsl` — split-K
///   flash DECODING, in two dispatches. `attn/sdpa_paged.wgsl`'s notes name
///   flash-decoding as the one restructure they do not cover, ceiling ~1.5x.
/// * `rms_norm_mul.wgsl` — the norm and the multiply that follows it in ONE
///   entrypoint. `serve::record`'s lever is *"fewer launches"*, and this is
///   what one fewer looks like.
/// * `mul_mat_reg_tile.wgsl` — register-tiled matmul, the shape between this
///   suite's `qmm_t` and the subgroup-matrix path.
/// * `gated_delta_net.wgsl` — a WGSL GDN, against `ssm/gdn_core.wgsl`.
///
/// Named rather than summarised: a reading of someone else's kernel is worth
/// nothing beside a measurement of ours, and the point of the list is that the

///
/// **8.4x**, and it is a naive kernel — one 16x16 tile per workgroup, no
/// shared-memory staging, no register blocking, K walked sixteen at a time
/// straight out of storage. So 22.4 TFLOP/s is the coop path's FLOOR rather
/// than its peak, and the distance from the shipped GEMM is not a tuning gap.
///
/// What it does not say: an affine-U4 kernel has to unpack into f16 fragments
/// before it can feed these, and that costs something this measurement does
/// not pay. The honest reading is that the arithmetic is 8x cheaper and the
/// dequantisation is now the open question, which is a different and much
/// better problem than "WGSL cannot reach the hardware".
///
/// # And 8.4x here is 1.3x at the shell, which is the number to plan against
///
/// `driver-wgpu`'s `where_a_prefills_time_goes_across_its_plan` budgets a
/// 512-row prefill: 815 ms, of which 250 is per-fire host, ~226 is weight GEMM
/// and ~339 is non-GEMM GPU work nobody has attributed yet. Make the GEMMs
/// 8.4x and 226 becomes 27 while the other 589 does not move — **815 ms to
/// ~616, 1.3x.**
///
/// This file has already published one isolated win that did not reach the
/// shell (the tile: 1.34x here, 7 % there). This is the same shape at a larger
/// scale. The cooperative-matrix quantised GEMM now EXISTS -- see
/// `what_the_cooperative_matrix_costs_when_it_is_fed_affine_u4`, 3.25x the

///
/// # Checked, because a kernel that computes nothing is also fast

/// `a` is f16 1.0 and `b` is f16 0.5, both exact, so every element of a

/// That test multiplies f16 and calls itself a ceiling for exactly this
/// reason: a real projection here unpacks 4-bit codes with a scale and a bias
/// per 64, and nothing had measured what feeding the tensor cores from those
/// costs.
///
/// # Why it can be done at all
///
/// `coopLoad` takes a pointer whose base is a scalar and naga's validator
/// asks nothing about its ADDRESS SPACE, so the standard trick is available:
/// dequantise a tile into `var<workgroup> array<f16>` and load the fragment
/// from there. The weight plane is `[n, k]` and the `B` role wants `[k, n]`,
/// so the staging loop transposes as it unpacks — which is free here, because
/// it is writing to workgroup memory either way.
///
/// The activation is f16 in storage and loads straight into the `A` fragment.
/// This backend's arena is bf16, so a shipped version pays one more
/// conversion; that is named rather than measured, and it is a widening of
/// 16 x 16 against a dequantisation of the same.
///
/// # The oracle
///
/// Every code is nibble 1, every scale 0.5, every bias 0, so every weight is
/// exactly 0.5 and every activation exactly 1.0 — which walks the whole unpack
/// (shift, mask, widen, multiply, add) and still lands on `k * 0.5 = 512` for
/// every output. A kernel that dropped the scale, the bias or the nibble would
/// miss it. The run says **0 of 1,835,008 wrong**.
///
/// # The number
///
/// | | ms | TFLOP/s |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | `qmm_t` 32x32, quantised (shipped) | 1.412 | 2.7 |
/// | **this, cooperative + affine-U4** | **0.435** | **8.6** |
/// | `coop_mat16x16` on plain f16 (ceiling) | 0.168 | 22.4 |
///
/// **3.25x the shipped kernel**, and 39 % of the f16 ceiling — so unpacking
/// costs 2.6x, which is the number that was missing and is much better than
/// the pessimistic reading. It is also a naive tile: 16x16 out, B restaged
/// every sixteen of K, no double buffering, no register blocking, one
/// `coopMultiplyAdd` per two `workgroupBarrier`s. Widening the tile amortises
/// the staging over more MMAs and is where the remaining 2.6x lives.
///
/// # What it buys at the shell, which is less
///
/// `driver-wgpu`'s prefill budget: 815 ms = 250 host + ~226 weight GEMM + ~339
/// unattributed non-GEMM. At 3.25x the GEMM line is 70 ms, so the fire is
/// ~659 ms — **1.24x.** Worth having and not worth reordering the roadmap for;
/// the 339 ms nobody has attributed is still the larger number.
///
/// # A naga landmine, which cost more than the kernel did
///
/// Writing `&c[row * n + col]` inline at BOTH the accumulator load and the

/// Bisected rather than guessed: a minimal shader established that a workgroup
/// `coopLoad` compiles, then that a workgroup `coopLoad` INSIDE a loop
/// compiles, which left the pointer arithmetic as the only difference.

/// WHAT THE FUSED GATED-DELTANET CORE COSTS, WHICH NOTHING HAS MEASURED.
///
/// `driver-wgpu`'s `whether_a_decode_costs_by_the_fire_or_by_the_launch` ends
/// by naming this kernel and saying no test in either crate dispatches it in
/// isolation. The arithmetic that got it there: a decode's per-layer sweep puts
/// a gated-DeltaNet layer at about 2.9 ms and there are eighteen of them, which
/// is 52 ms against a decode of roughly 50 -- so the cost is in those layers,
/// and the thirteen launches of one are twelve projections at the floor plus
/// this.
///
/// It is the only kernel in the mix that touches the recurrent state: a
/// megabyte a layer read and written, against 187 projections that share a
/// quarter of a gigabyte of weights between them.
///
/// Shaped as the model fires it -- one decode row, 16 value heads of 128 over
/// 16 key heads of 128, a 6144-channel fused conv at width 4 -- so the number
/// is the model's and not a microbenchmark's.
///
/// # What it says, and the reason sitting in the body
///
///     median 0.7736 ms, fastest 0.4565
///     2.0 MB of recurrent state -> 4.6 GB/s effective
///     eighteen of them a token is 8.2 ms
///
/// Half a percent of this adapter's bandwidth, and 8.2 ms of a decode that
/// runs about 50. The projections next to it are AT the dispatch floor; this
/// is not.
///
/// The body says why. `qraw` and `kraw` are convolved from `q_off`/`k_off` at
/// `hk_idx`, and neither index depends on `dv_idx` -- but `dv_idx` is `gid.y`
/// and runs 0..127, so every one of the 128 value rows of a head convolves the
/// same query and key channels and L2-normalises them again. 128x redundant,
/// and the same pathology `affine_qmv_fast` had: a quantity recomputed per row
/// that does not vary by row.
///
/// It is why the SPLIT pair exists -- `gdn_prep` stages q and k once and
/// `gdn_core_recurrent` reads them -- and a decode fires the fused one.
///
/// Four of the 128 share a workgroup, so four of them can be folded through
/// `var<workgroup>`. That was written -- with the barrier care it needs, since
/// `row_sum32` is workgroup-wide and the rows that skip the convolution still
/// have to reach every call of it -- and it is SLOWER, twice measured:
///
///     baseline                          0.4565 ms
///     shared, read in the inner loops   0.8671
///     shared, hoisted into registers    0.5321
///
/// So the redundancy is not costing what it looks like it costs. 128 rows
/// convolving the same channels read the same addresses, which the cache
/// serves; what they spend is L1 throughput and arithmetic, not bandwidth, and
/// replacing that with workgroup memory and an extra barrier costs more than
/// it saves even when the values are hoisted back into registers before the
/// inner loops.
///
/// Which leaves the 4.6 GB/s unexplained by the obvious reading. The batch
/// sweep explains it:
///
///     rows=1    0.4415 ms    2 MB state     4.8 GB/s   per row 0.4415 ms
///     rows=4    0.8430       8 MB          10.0        per row 0.2107
///     rows=16   0.5270      32 MB          63.7        per row 0.0329
///
/// Sixteen times the work in about the same time. At the ROW COUNT A DECODE
/// FIRES -- one -- this kernel is waiting on its fixed cost and not on its
/// arithmetic: 512 workgroups of 128 threads, four state elements a lane, and
/// four `row_sum32` calls between them.
///
/// So no rewrite of the body helps a single-row decode, which is what the two
/// shared-memory attempts above found the hard way. The lever is rows -- more
/// conversations in one fire, or fusing the statements around this one -- and
/// both are lowering, not WGSL. The 63.7 GB/s at sixteen rows is the same body
/// on the same adapter, which is the proof that the body is not the problem.
