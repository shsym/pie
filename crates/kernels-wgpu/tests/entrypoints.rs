//! The table's product, against the shader tree — and against `kernels-metal`.
//!
//! Invariant (1), which this backend inherits from both siblings:
//!
//! > every entrypoint in `kernels/` resolves to exactly one (row, axis point),
//! > and every (row, axis point) to exactly one entrypoint
//!
//! ## Why this one test does what Vulkan needs two and a Python script for
//!
//! `kernels-vulkan` splits the comparison in two hops: a `--check` mode of
//! `scripts/vulkan-kernel-audit.py` reads the `.comp` tree and writes
//! `entrypoints.generated.txt`, and a Rust test then compares that file to the
//! table. The split is forced — proving a declared variant COMPILES means
//! running `glslc`, and a `cargo test` that shells out to a Vulkan toolchain is
//! a test that fails on every box without one.
//!
//! There is no toolchain here. The directive parser is `kernels_wgpu::preproc`,
//! a library function; the shader tree is `kernels_wgpu::SOURCES`, embedded in
//! the rlib; and expanding a variant is `kernels_wgpu::entrypoint_source`,
//! which is Rust. So the tree half and the table half are both reachable from
//! one `#[test]`, with nothing to install and nothing to keep in step.
//!
//! `entrypoints.generated.txt` is gone, along with the `write_census` example
//! that wrote it. Nothing needed it to run — it was the artifact a human diffed
//! against `kernels-metal`'s and `kernels-vulkan`'s copies, a set difference in
//! a review rather than a number in a test log — and that is exactly what its
//! removal costs. What it did NOT carry is this crate's own shader-vs-table
//! check, which reads the tree directly and is unaffected.
//!
//! ## What this file does NOT prove
//!
//! That a module compiles. `naga` is the WGSL front end and it lives in `wgpu`,
//! which is a DEV-dependency of this crate for the reason `Cargo.toml` gives —
//! so the parse check lives in `tests/gpu.rs` beside the dispatches, and this
//! file stays a comparison between two descriptions.

// gate — text against text, so a fact stated in one table and not the other
// failed here rather than in whichever driver read it.
//
// They compared against `kernels-metal` until `489a36031` emptied it, then
// against `kernels-vulkan`, which agreed everywhere but `route_gather` — the
// one entry in the fleet's `DRIFTED`. Then vulkan finished Stage 4 too, and
// **this crate is the last with rows**: `kernels-wgpu` 82, `kernels-vulkan`
// 1, `kernels-metal` 0. There is nothing left to compare against, and a
// scrape that reads one row is not a weaker check, it is no check.
//
// What replaces them, and it is not nothing:
// `kernels/tests/shader_backends_agree.rs` compares ROUTINE signatures
// across all three backends, which is the same claim about the same kernels
// with the tables taken out of the middle. That gate grows as this one
// shrinks, which is the trade Stage 3 was for.
//
// Do not restore these against a one-row table. If a sibling grows rows
// again that is a revert, not a reference.
//
// The operands this table deliberately asks for differently, and why.
//
// Not a skip list: the test asserts each entry still names a REAL difference
// (see the staleness check), so an exception that outlives its reason fails
// rather than accumulates.
//
// `sdpa_paged_decode{,_sink}` operand 13 is the mask PITCH. `kernels-metal`
// takes it from `Source::Param(3)` -- a launch parameter, which means from
// the model TEXT -- and no text can know it: the pitch is a property of the
// fire the driver is building, not of the program being lowered, and every
// text in the corpus states `0` there. Zero is the value the shader reads as
// "forbid every key of an enabled row", so a mask bound through that slot
// answers nothing rather than answering wrongly -- which is the safe
// direction and still not the mask the guest asked for.
//
// This table asks for `Source::AttentionMaskStride`, which the driver
// answers from the fire it is assembling. `tart-masked` runs on this backend
// because of it, and `driver-wgpu/tests/serving.rs` holds the numeric pair
// that says so: a causal mask gives bit-identical logits to no mask, and
// forbidding half the keys moves the answer.
// The tiled pair joined the list when upstream STATED their operands in
// `kernels-metal`: they carry the same seventeen the decode rows do, in the
// same order, so they carry the same divergence at the same index. The row
// count is an eighteenth operand and sits past it. The MMA pair joined the
// same way one rebase later, and for the same reason — this backend's
// `attn/sdpa_paged_mma.wgsl` is Metal's entrypoint names over a scalar body
// with the tiled shader's exact buffers and scalars.
//
// Both times the gap outlived the commit that opened it. `kernels-metal`
// stated the operands, this table went on stating none, and nothing said so
// until THIS file was next run — which is a parity gate that lives in one of
// three crates being only as good as the habit of running that crate.
// EMPTY, and the six entries that stood here did not go because they were
// settled.
//
// They recorded operand 13 of the six `sdpa_paged_*` rows: metal reads the
// TEXT's scalar there and this backend reads `Source::AttentionMaskStride`,
// the pitch the driver actually staged. Then metal finished Stage 4, its
// `KERNELS` emptied, and the scrape above had no rows to read at all — so
// this comparison was repointed at `kernels-vulkan`, which still has 94, and
// wgpu and vulkan AGREE at operand 13. The exceptions became unobservable
// rather than resolved.
//
// The record did not move with them, and that is the point of writing this
// down: `kernels/tests/shader_backends_agree.rs`'s `DRIFTED` still carries
// all six with the sentence explaining which backend is wrong, and
// `kernels`'s `the_two_settled_drifts_are_still_true_of_the_drivers_they_name`
// still reports `AttentionMaskStride` in ZERO places in `driver-metal`. The
// defect is live; only this crate's view of it is gone.
