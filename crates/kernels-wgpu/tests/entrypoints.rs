//! The table's product, against the shader tree — and against `kernels-metal`.
//!
//! Invariant (1), which this backend inherits from both siblings:
//!
//! > every entrypoint in `kernels/` resolves to exactly one (row, axis point),
//! > and every (row, axis point) to exactly one entrypoint
//!
//! ## Why this one test does what Vulkan needs two and a Python script for
//!
//! `kernels-vulkan` splits the comparison in two hops: a `--check` mode of
//! `scripts/vulkan-kernel-audit.py` reads the `.comp` tree and writes
//! `entrypoints.generated.txt`, and a Rust test then compares that file to the
//! table. The split is forced — proving a declared variant COMPILES means
//! running `glslc`, and a `cargo test` that shells out to a Vulkan toolchain is
//! a test that fails on every box without one.
//!
//! There is no toolchain here. The directive parser is `kernels_wgpu::preproc`,
//! a library function; the shader tree is `kernels_wgpu::SOURCES`, embedded in
//! the rlib; and expanding a variant is `kernels_wgpu::entrypoint_source`,
//! which is Rust. So the tree half and the table half are both reachable from
//! one `#[test]`, with nothing to install and nothing to keep in step.
//!
//! `entrypoints.generated.txt` is still committed, and it is still checked. Not
//! because anything needs it to run, but because it is the artifact a human
//! diffs against `kernels-metal`'s and `kernels-vulkan`'s copies — a set
//! difference in a review, rather than a number in a test log.
//!
//! ## What this file does NOT prove
//!
//! That a module compiles. `naga` is the WGSL front end and it lives in `wgpu`,
//! which is a DEV-dependency of this crate for the reason `Cargo.toml` gives —
//! so the parse check lives in `tests/gpu.rs` beside the dispatches, and this
//! file stays a comparison between two descriptions.
