//! The index over the kernels the host emitted, and what a lookup can find.
//!
//! A [`ProgramRegistration`] carries a flat `Vec<EmittedKernel>`, each tagged
//! with `(kind, stage_index, region_index)`. The driver needs them by that
//! triple, so it builds a map once at bind. That is `HostEmittedKernels` in the
//! C++ and [`Emitted`] here.
//!
//! ## An empty source and an empty error are not the same as a kernel
//!
//! `EmittedKernel` has three states packed into two strings. A populated
//! `source` is a kernel. An empty `source` with a populated `error` is a
//! *deliberate* refusal — the host looked at the region, decided it could not
//! emit for it, and said why, so the driver can take its slower path knowing
//! this is a designed fallback and not a bug. The C++ knew this and has a
//! comment about it:
//!
//! > callers check `error` before `source` to preserve the fallback that the
//! > old `emit_*_msl(...) == false` return took.
//!
//! A convention enforced by a comment on the container, at a call site the
//! comment is not next to. [`Slot`] makes the three states three variants, so
//! there is no order to check them in.
//!
//! There is also a fourth state the C++ had no words for: both strings empty.
//! `find` returned that entry like any other and the caller compiled `""`.
//! [`Slot::Malformed`] names it.
//!
//! [`ProgramRegistration`]: driver_api::plan::ProgramRegistration
