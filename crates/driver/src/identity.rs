//! What the compile cache is keyed on.
//!
//! A compiled pipeline state is expensive enough that this shell caches it in
//! memory, on disk as an `mtl4archive`, and — for the failures worth not
//! retrying — negatively. All three are keyed on one string, and that string
//! has exactly one job: **two runs that would compile different code must never
//! produce the same key.** Every field below exists because it is something a
//! compilation depends on and that can change without the program changing.
//!
//! The key is a 22-byte record in hexadecimal, followed by a `-v` suffix
//! carrying the four version numbers in the clear. The split is not decorative.
//! The record is what identifies the compilation; the suffix is what a human
//! reads off a stale archive filename to see *which* version moved. Only the
//! compiler version appears in both.
//!
//! # The suffix is a concatenation with no separators
//!
//! `-v` is followed by four fixed-width hex fields run together. Nothing marks
//! their boundaries, so the widths must match the field types exactly. The C++
//! wrote them with `std::setw`, which **pads but never truncates**: a value too
//! wide for its field is printed at full width and shifts every field after it,
//! and the suffix becomes ambiguous — two different version tuples encoding to
//! one string, which is precisely the collision the key exists to prevent. The
//! C++ was safe from this only because its field widths happened to match its
//! `uint16_t`/`uint32_t` field types, not because anything checked. Here the
//! widths are derived from the types and a test pins that the encoding's length
//! is the same for all-zero versions as for all-max ones.
//!
//! # Why the emitter version is `u32` here and was `u16` there
//!
//! The C++ driver hardcoded `kMetalM1EmitterVersion = 23` — a copy, kept by
//! hand, of a number owned by the host emitter. The copy has already drifted:
//! the host is at 36. A driver-side copy of another component's version cannot
//! do the job the comment claims for it ("so a stale mtl4archive never survives
//! a host-side emitter bump"), because the host can bump without the driver
//! noticing. The launch ABI already carries the real number —
//! [`ProgramRegistration::emitter_version`], documented as "part of the
//! driver's compile-cache key, so a bump must miss rather than reuse" — and it
//! is a `u32`. Narrowing it to `u16` to fit the old field would be a silent
//! collision at 65536, so the field is a `u32` and its suffix width is eight.
//!
