//! What the kernel left behind: the 16-byte status word and how to read it.
//!
//! Every M1, M2 and M3 dispatch writes one `M1Status` into a device buffer the
//! driver allocated and zeroed. When the command finishes, that struct is the
//! entire account of what the GPU did — there is no other channel, no log, and
//! nothing to re-run. Reading it wrongly is not a cosmetic problem: the caller
//! decides between committing the fire, retrying it, and refusing it on the
//! basis of these four words.
//!
//! ## The fault space is named, and the C++ did not use the names
//!
//! `compiler/codegen/src/fault.rs` declares every number a kernel can leave in
//! `fault`, with a test that the classes cannot alias. Its own module doc says
//! "Nothing decodes these: the drivers surface the number and a human reads
//! it." That was true, and it is the thing this module changes. The classes are
//! written down; a driver that prints `160` when the host has a constant saying
//! `FUSED_GEOMETRY_MISMATCH` is discarding information it already has.
//!
//! The constants are restated here rather than imported because this crate does
//! not depend on `tensor-compiler` at build time — the same reason
//! `identity::Versions` is a parameter. [`FAULT_CLASSES`] is the mirror and
//! [`describe_fault`] reads it. A hand-copied table that nothing checks drifts,
//! so the compiler is a *dev*-dependency and
//! [`the_mirror_still_matches_the_compilers_table`](tests) compares the two
//! entry by entry.
