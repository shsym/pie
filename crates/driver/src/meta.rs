//! What the driver works out once, at bind, from a stage plan.
//!
//! Two things are derived from a program at register time and then read on
//! every fire: where each op's results land in the stage's value array, and
//! what each channel's effect on the ring is. Neither depends on the device,
//! on the fire's numbers, or on anything that changes between fires — they are
//! functions of the plan, so they are computed once and stored.
//!
//! The C++ put the first in `region_support.hpp` as
//! `collect_singleton_metadata` and then wrote the same loop out again, inline
//! and by hand, three more times: once in the M2 validation pass, once in the
//! M2 command builder, once in the M3 lane builder. Four copies of a running
//! sum is four chances to write `+= 1` instead of `+= op.results`. It is one
//! function here and the three call sites use it.
//!
//! The second is the `effects.resize(...)` loop in `compile_program`. It is
//! here because it is the same kind of thing — a fold over the plan with no
//! device in it — and because it is what [`readiness::check`] consumes, so the
//! two belong next to each other.
//!
