//! Where one fire's values live in the scratch buffer.
//!
//! A fire's intermediate values are not separate allocations. The host takes
//! one transient buffer, decides an offset for every value in it, and hands the
//! kernels the offset table; the kernels then address their inputs and outputs
//! as slices of that one buffer. This module is that decision, and it is the
//! only thing that knows the buffer's shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0                    256                                  temporary
//! +--------------------+-----------+-----------+-- ... --+-------------+
//! | dummy binding      | value 0   | value 1   |         | temporaries |
//! +--------------------+-----------+-----------+-- ... --+-------------+
//! ```
//!
//! The first 256 bytes are a **dummy binding**: emitted kernels declare
//! argument slots they do not always use, and Metal has no null buffer
//! argument, so every unused slot is pointed at this region. Nothing reads it
//! and nothing may write it. Reserving it here rather than allocating a
//! separate buffer costs 256 bytes of a buffer that is already at least that
//! big, and saves a second transient allocation per fire.
//!
//! The tail is scratch the kernels use for reductions and sort keys, sized for
//! the largest value in the fire because a kernel does not know which value it
//! will be run over until it is dispatched.
//!
//! # Why everything is aligned
//!
//! Every offset is a multiple of [`ALIGN`]. That is not a performance
//! preference: a Metal buffer binding takes an offset, and an unaligned one is
//! rejected by the API. Alignment is applied to each value's *size* as well as
//! to its offset, which is redundant given a 256-aligned start -- but it is what
//! keeps the running total aligned without the loop having to reason about it,
//! so the redundancy is the invariant rather than a waste.
//!
//! # Why the arithmetic is checked
//!
//! The C++ accumulated the running total with `+=`, aligned with
//! `(value + alignment - 1) / alignment * alignment`, and only tested the
//! result against the 512 MiB bound *after* the loop had finished. Both steps
//! can wrap on a `size_t`, and a wrapped total passes a bound check that a real
//! one would fail -- which is the worst possible outcome, since the buffer then
//! gets allocated at the wrapped size and the kernels address it at the real
//! offsets. The C++ half-noticed this and added `scratch_bytes < temporary_offset`
//! to catch a wrap in the final addition only. Here every step is checked, so
//! the bound check means what it says.
