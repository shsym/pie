//! Whether a fire may run right now.
//!
//! A fire reads and writes channels, and a channel is a bounded ring shared
//! with whoever else touches it. Before anything is encoded the host asks, for
//! every channel the fire touches: is there something to take, is there room to
//! put, and is this ring still at the sequence the batch was composed against?
//! Three answers are possible and they are not interchangeable —
//!
//! * [`Readiness::Ready`] — encode it.
//! * [`Readiness::Retry`] — nothing is wrong; the fire is early. The producer
//!   has not run, or the consumer has not drained, or another fire moved the
//!   ring since this batch was composed. Try again next pass.
//! * [`Readiness::Failed`] — the fire will never be runnable. A poisoned or
//!   closed channel, or a ring whose words are not self-consistent.
//!
//! Collapsing the middle one into either of the others is the mistake this
//! module exists to prevent: reported as a failure it kills a request that was
//! merely early, and reported as ready it encodes a kernel that reads a cell
//! nobody wrote.
//!
//! # Tickets
//!
//! A ticket is the head and tail a channel had when the batch was composed. It
//! is not a readiness condition of its own — it is the check that the ring has
//! not moved underneath a decision already made. A fire composed against
//! `head = 4` that arrives to find `head = 5` has had its cell taken by someone
//! else, and running it would consume the wrong one. That is a retry, not a
//! failure: recomposing against the new head is exactly the remedy.
//!
//! A [`NO_TICKET`] entry means the composer did not pin that end, and the
//! corresponding check is skipped. The C++ spelled it `~std::uint64_t{0}` and
//! compared against it inline; here it is a named constant, because a sentinel
//! that shares a field with real values is only safe while every reader
//! remembers it is there.
//!
//! # The put credit
//!
//! An op that both takes from and puts to one channel does not need a free slot
//! before it runs: the take it performs first frees one. So a put is allowed
//! against a ring at exactly capacity when the same fire is also taking from it
//! and is waiting on that ring being non-empty. That one-slot credit is the
//! only reason a self-recursive stage does not deadlock at capacity, and it is
//! why [`Effect`] carries `take` and `put` separately rather than one direction.
