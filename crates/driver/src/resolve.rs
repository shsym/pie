//! Reading a fire's geometry out of the channels the last fire wrote it into.
//!
//! # What device-resolved geometry is
//!
//! Ordinarily the host decides how many tokens a fire has, which KV pages each
//! request may address, and where the results are read out, and it sends those
//! numbers down with the fire. A program with device-resolved geometry does
//! not: the previous fire's epilogue *computed* them and put them on channels,
//! and the numbers never left the device. This reads those channels before the
//! forward and fills in the same [`Geometry`] the host would have sent, so
//! everything downstream runs on the ordinary batch machinery and needs to
//! know nothing about the program that produced them.
//!
//! # This is a copier, not a policy
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything. It is a port-to-field copy applying exactly
//! two fixed contracts, both of which belong to the port definitions rather
//! than to any program:
//!
//! * **CSR prefix.** A data port and its `indptr` come as a pair, the channel
//!   shapes are fixed, and the program packs the live entries at the front.
//!   The last element of the `indptr` is therefore the valid length of the
//!   data, and everything past it is whatever was there last time.
//! * **`kv_len` to a last-page length.** `((len - 1) % page) + 1`, which is
//!   the port's own semantics.
//!
//! Any beam search, speculative decode or run-ahead logic lives in the program
//! that wrote the channels. If a rule here ever needs to know which program it
//! is serving, the rule is in the wrong place.
//!
//! # Reading here does not consume
//!
//! Every read is a peek at the committed front of the ring. The actual take
//! for the ports that consume happens once, later, in the interpreter's own
//! port loop, which is unchanged. Two takes would drop a cell, and the symptom
//! would be a fire silently reading the fire-after-next's tokens.
//!
//! # Empty is not malformed
//!
//! An empty descriptor channel is [`Resolution::NotReady`] and a wrongly typed
//! one is [`Resolution::Failed`], and they are different because the remedies
//! are opposite. Not-ready means the producer has not run yet and waiting
//! fixes it. Failed means waiting never will. The C++ returns one status enum
//! for this reason and it is preserved; what is dropped is the out-parameter
//! `std::string* err` beside it, because a status that carries no reason and a
//! reason that arrives by side channel are the two halves of one value.
