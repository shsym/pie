//! What a `.spv` says about itself.
//!
//! A driver holds the module anyway, and three of the numbers it needs to
//! dispatch one are inside it rather than in any table: the workgroup size, the
//! highest binding a descriptor set must cover, and — for deciding whether a
//! grid may be rounded — whether the shader reads its own workgroup count.
//!
//! Reading them here rather than restating them in `kernels-vulkan`'s table is
//! not a preference. A table entry can drift from the shader it describes; a
//! byte read out of the module cannot. Every one of these was measured against
//! all 665 compiled modules before it was written down.
//!
//! No `ash` and no device: this is a byte parser, so it is in the portable half
//! and its tests run anywhere.
