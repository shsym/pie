//! What a statement supplies a routine, per routine.
//!
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §7 Stage 4, and §6's *"the `operands`
//! column, as code"*. A routine's signature says what it takes and in what
//! order; it does not say where any of it comes from. That is a fact about
//! the STATEMENT — the third input, the second weight, the fire's position
//! table, the layer's KV pages — and an arm is where it is written.
//!
//! # Why this is a function per routine and not a table
//!
//! It was a table. [`kernels::KernelSig::operands`] is that table, and
//! `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §8a is the class of defect it admits:
//! a row states a [`kernels::Source`] for every slot, the slots are
//! positional, and a row that names one too few or one too many binds every
//! argument after it one place off. Nothing checks a row against the kernel it
//! describes, because a row is data and the kernel is a shader in another
//! language.
//!
//! An arm is a CALL. It hands its values to a `pub fn` whose parameters have
//! types and names, so an argument list one short does not compile. That is
//! the trade this refactor makes: the same information, moved from a place
//! where only a device could disagree with it to a place where the compiler
//! does.
//!
//! # What an arm may not do
//!
//! Compute a grid. Every arm here is operand plumbing and nothing else: the
//! numbers a launch is built from reach the routine as arguments and the
//! ROUTINE states its own rectangle. An arm that did arithmetic would put the
//! second opinion back — see `.wiki/kernel-x/refactor-bigplan.md` §6, *"the
//! QMM tile is chosen in `model/` and again in `launch.rs`, compared
//! nowhere"*.
//!
//! # How this differs from `driver-metal/src/lowering/arm.rs`
//!
//! Two things, and both are the crate boundary rather than a decision.
//!
//! **A missing driver resource is a refusal here, not a zero handle.** Metal's
//! [`Handles::table`] answers a null [`Slice`](crate::device::Bound) for a
//! fire table the resolver does not hold, because a Metal argument slot left
//! unbound holds whatever address the previous dispatch put there. This
//! driver's [`crate::binding::Resolve`] returns `Option<&Buffer>` and
//! [`crate::binding::reorder`] already refuses with
//! [`Unbindable::NoDriverResource`](crate::binding::Unbindable), so an arm
//! refuses too and the two planes give the same answer.
//!
//! **There is no `params_block`.** Metal mints a handle standing for the
//! statement's scalar run because MSL has no push constants and every scalar
//! rides a buffer. Here the split is the MODULE's: a routine hands its scalars
//! over as [`ArgValue`] words and [`crate::encode::Encoder`] asks
//! [`crate::binding::params_from`] which of push constants and a storage
//! struct this module declared. The reachable symbols divide almost evenly on
//! it, so neither answer could have been assumed on either side.
