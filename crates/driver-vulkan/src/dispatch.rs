//! One launch of a plan, turned into the four things a dispatch needs.
//!
//! [`binding`](crate::binding) answers where an operand lives, and
//! [`geometry`](crate::geometry) answers how many workgroups a rule wants.
//! Neither knows about the other, and a plan states neither directly: it
//! states a rectangle, a symbol, and a run of operands. This file is the
//! join. It turns one [`Launch`] into a [`Dispatch`] — a module name, its
//! bound operands, its push bytes, and its grid — and nothing here needs a
//! device, so the whole join can be measured against real plans on a machine
//! with no GPU in it.
//!
//! # Why the grid needs the statement and not just the fire
//!
//! A [`Rule`] evaluates against [`Dims`], and most of `Dims` is fire-wide:
//! head count, head width, expert count. Most, not all. `KernelSig` carries
//! three indices — `grid_param`, `head_param`, `heads_param` — that each name
//! a scalar in the STATEMENT's own run, and a row that names one is saying
//! its extent varies per layer in a way no fire-wide number can express.
//!
//! Gemma-4 is the case that forces it: its full-attention layers rotate a
//! quarter of each head and its sliding layers rotate all of one, and they
//! carry four 512-wide KV heads against sixteen 256-wide ones. A driver
//! reading the fire's `rotary_dims` describes neither. `driver-metal` learned
//! this and states so at [`dims_of`]'s counterpart; the reading is
//! transcribed rather than rediscovered.
//!
//! A row naming a param its statement does not carry falls back to the fire
//! rather than to zero, because a grid of zero is a dispatch that runs
//! nothing, returns success, and leaves the output holding whatever it was
//! born with. That failure mode is the one this crate refuses hardest —
//! [`Device::run`](crate::device::Device::run) refuses a zero grid outright.
