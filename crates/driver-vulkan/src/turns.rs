//! One fire after another, over the same cache.
//!
//! Everything below this is per-fire: [`serve::fire`] runs a lowering once,
//! [`Frame`] describes one moment, [`logits`] reads one answer. A server is
//! none of those. It is the same pool, the same weights and the same pipeline
//! cache carried across thousands of fires while conversations arrive, grow
//! and leave -- and the parts that can only be wrong ACROSS fires live here
//! because there is nowhere else they could live.
//!
//! There are three of them, and each was reachable before this module existed:
//!
//! 1. A conversation's pages must be its own from its first fire to its last.
//!    [`Book`] answers that; a caller that grew a request by hand did not.
//! 2. A conversation's positions must continue. Every test in this crate
//!    before this one wrote `(0..n)` and re-fired from scratch, which is a
//!    prefill repeated, not a decode.
//! 3. A deployment needs BOTH plans. `llama_like_metal` traced at
//!    `FireClass::Prefill` states tiled GEMMs where the same text traced at
//!    `FireClass::Decode` states matrix-vector products, and `Serving` held
//!    one plan until that was measured -- so a prompt was answered one row at
//!    a time by the decode kernel. The divergence starts at SIXTEEN rows, the
//!    tile height; below that the two plans lower identically.
//! 4. The lowering is per-fire and the pipelines are not. A step that rebuilt
//!    its pipelines would be correct and unusably slow, and nothing measured
//!    it.
//!
//! # What a step is not
//!
//! It does not sample. [`Step::logits`] is a distribution and the token that
//! comes back next fire is the caller's to choose -- which is the same place
//! `driver-metal` stops, and not an accident: the temperature, the top-k and
//! the seed belong to a request, and a driver that owned them would own the
//! request too.
//!
//! It does not keep the arena. Each step allocates one and frees it, because
//! `Lowered::arena_bytes` depends on the row count and the row count changes
//! every step. A server that fired the same shape repeatedly would want to
//! keep the largest and reuse it; nothing here does, and the cost is one
//! allocation per fire rather than one per token.
//!
//! [`serve::fire`]: crate::serve::fire
//! [`logits`]: crate::serve::logits
