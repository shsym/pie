//! The device half, on a real GPU.
//!
//! `tests/rules.rs` proves the launch arithmetic against the modules as FILES.
//! This proves the rest of it against hardware: that a pipeline built from what
//! a module declares is one the driver accepts, that a grid this crate computed
//! covers the work, and that the numbers that come back are the numbers a
//! host-side reference computes.
//!
//! Skipped, with a reason, when there is no GPU or no modules. That is the
//! normal state of a build machine and not a failure.
//!
//! # A pass here is weaker than it looks without the validation layer
//!
//! Vulkan answers most malformed requests by doing something undefined rather
//! than by failing, so numbers that match are not evidence that a dispatch was
//! legal. [`Device::validated`] reports whether a layer is watching, and
//! `a_layer_is_watching` prints when one is not. To get one:
//!
//! ```text
//! VK_LAYER_PATH=/path/to/explicit_layer.d cargo test -p driver-vulkan --features native
//! ```
//!
//! # One device, shared, behind a lock
//!
//! Every test here used to open its own device, and therefore its own
//! instance. Twice, under the validation layer, the process SIGABRTed after
//! the last test with every test reporting `ok`, no VUID and no message.
//!
//! That is worth an explicit note, because a SIGABRT after a run of `ok`s
//! looks exactly like a test that broke something, and chasing it cost an
//! hour. What settled it at the time was that a clean checkout did the same,
//! and that any single test under the layer was silent.
//!
//! # What is and is not claimed about that
//!
//! The suite now opens ONE device, made once and never destroyed until the
//! process exits, behind a `Mutex` -- a Vulkan command pool and queue are
//! externally synchronised objects, and sharing without the lock would trade
//! a layer bug for a real one.
//!
//! That was worth doing on its own terms: the suite went from 7.4 seconds to
//! 1.15, because opening sixteen devices was most of what it was doing.
//!
//! It is NOT claimed to have fixed the abort. Reverting to a device per test
//! and running the suite twelve more times under the layer produced twelve
//! clean runs, so the failure is intermittent and no longer reproducible on
//! demand -- which means the control that would prove a fix cannot be made
//! to fire. Sharing one instance removes the most plausible cause, a race in
//! the layer's own teardown across concurrently destroyed instances, and
//! that is as much as the evidence supports.

    // a plan ever asking for it; this is the first run in which a real one
    // does.
    //
    // Was nineteen until the compiler stopped sending an MXFP4 expert bank
    // to the unbiased routed symbol. The bank publishes one additive term
    // per output row, `mxfp4_qmv_routed_bias` is the kernel that reads it,
    // and this crate binds and dispatches it unchanged -- so the twentieth
    // row arrived without a line of driver code, which is the point of
    // deriving bindings from the statement rather than from a table.

    // Still the same number after three texts became six, and that is the finding
    // rather than a non-event: qwen2.5, mistral and olmo2 are three more
    // architectures and they reach not one kernel the first three did not.
    // A dense llama-like decode is the same rows at different
    // widths, so what widens this number is a STRUCTURE nothing here has --
    // a mixture of experts did, a sink attention did, a prefill did -- and
    // not another model.
    //
    // Was thirteen, then fourteen. The last five arrived together when the
    // scalar run started being built from the kernel row rather than taken
    // whole, and when this loop started stating the model's geometry --
    // `sdpa_paged_decode` is compiled for a fixed head width and a plan does
    // not carry one.
    //
    // Also the first time `kv_append_paged` and the paged attentions reach a
    // device at all. They are the rows with descriptor holes, the rows that
    // interleave driver numbers among the statement's scalars, and the only
    // rows that put anything on the grid's third dimension.
    //
    // Then twenty-two, when a rescaled deployment reached these texts:
    // `neox_freqs_mb` is the rotation whose ladder is handed over as a buffer
    // rather than raised from a base, and `rope.rs` builds that buffer.
    //
    // Then twenty-four, when a text quantised at 8 bits arrived upstream: a
    // point carries the bit width, so the same projection at 8 bits names a
    // symbol its 4-bit sibling does not, twice -- once for the GEMM and once
    // for the GEMV.
    //
    // Then twenty-six, when the two `sdpa_paged_tiled` rows stopped being
    // bare axes and started stating their operands: a prefill reaches the
    // tile, a decode reaches the decode kernel, and both are in these texts.

/// A routed prefill answers the same twice, though its arena does not.
///
/// This test has now been wrong in both directions, and both corrections are
/// kept because the pair is the actual finding.
///
/// It began by asserting that two runs of one routed fire leave DIFFERENT
/// arenas and the same logits, hunting up to five runs for a difference. Then
/// upstream fixed a real race -- `route_sort`'s `n` was `n_experts * k` where
/// `expert_ids` holds `tokens * k`, so the kernel scanned 112 entries past
/// its region into the `perm` it was concurrently writing -- and the hunt
/// stopped finding anything. So the claim was inverted to byte equality, on
/// the reading that a fixed kernel is a reproducible one, and it passed three
/// times.
///
/// It was luck. The arenas are NOT equal, and the reason is the one this
/// suite had written down all along, in `whole_plan`'s own comment: the
/// permutation is built with workgroup-scoped atomics, so which of two rows
/// wanting the same expert lands first is whichever lane won the atomic. That
/// is a design, not a defect -- the same bump-counter every backend's router
/// uses -- and it survives the fix, because the race and the ordering were
/// two separate things sharing one symptom.
///
/// Measured, when the byte claim finally failed: 75k to 198k of 6.2M arena
/// bytes differ, run to run, and 141 bytes of `route_sort`'s own 512-byte
/// `perm` region are among them. That last number is what makes this an
/// ordering rather than an overrun -- the difference is INSIDE the buffer the
/// router owns, not past it -- and it is why a byte comparison cannot be the
/// claim here.
///
/// So the claim is what the ordering cannot move: the ANSWER. That was first
/// spelled as every row's argmax agreeing, and it was wrong a THIRD time --
/// which is the third correction kept here.
///
/// It flaked, about one run in three, always on row 0. The diagnosis: this
/// fixture's logits sit near 9728, where bf16's seven mantissa bits space the
/// representable values exactly 64 apart, and 3271 different tokens held the
/// top value. A plateau that wide makes an argmax a report of scan order, and
/// the run-to-run difference that reshuffled it was 64 -- one ULP, the
/// smallest difference expressible there. The test called that "the router's
/// ordering reached the ranking".
///
/// Two things came out of chasing it. The fixture's weight fill was
/// `i * 31 % 251`, whose 251-byte period aliases with every one of these
/// models' head row strides, so hundreds of vocabulary rows were byte
/// identical; `whole_plan`'s `fill_of` explains the hash that replaced it.
/// And the ULP itself is not the driver's ordering: it survives
/// `one_at_a_time`, which submits every dispatch on its own fence and is the
/// strongest ordering Vulkan has. What it was, was the router being handed
/// tied scores by a periodic fixture and breaking the tie with an atomic.
///
/// The claim now is EQUALITY OF THE WHOLE DISTRIBUTION, which is strictly
/// stronger than the argmax it replaced and cannot go quiet on a plateau.
/// The relative bound stays beside it as the weaker, more legible statement
/// of the same thing.
///
/// What this no longer catches is an overrun that changes the arena without
/// changing the answer. That is `whole_plan`'s job and it does it properly:
/// it re-runs the reference against itself precisely so it can tell "the
/// batching is wrong" from "the plan has no single answer", which is the
/// distinction this test spent two revisions failing to make.

/// The claims are about bookkeeping, not numerics -- the weights are a stand-in,

/// - the pipeline cache stops growing, which is the only reason a server can
///   afford to lower every fire.
///
/// Then a prefill and a mixed batch -- one conversation decoding while another
/// prefills -- which is the shape a server actually runs and which nothing in

/// why they could not, since the reason is a real disagreement in the lowering

/// it is the first circuit a language model learns and it is entirely about
/// COPYING, so the ids need not spell anything.
///
/// # What that proves that nothing else here does
///
/// Induction is a claim across positions, so it fails if anything that spans
/// positions is wrong -- and those are exactly the things a single fire cannot
/// check:
///
///   - the rotary angles, since the head must compare position `i` with
///     position `i - period` and a wrong `theta` or a wrong offset destroys
///     the match;
///   - the KV cache's paging, since the earlier occurrence lives in a page
///     written by an earlier fire;
///   - the positions the book hands each step, since an off-by-one restarts
///     the sequence;
///   - the prefill and the decode plans agreeing, since the pattern is
///     prefilled and the continuation is decoded.
///
/// A single wrong one of those still produces finite, non-flat logits.
///
/// # The controls, including the one that did not fire
///
/// Zeroing the weights answers `[151935, 151935, 151935, 151935]` -- the last
/// id in the vocabulary, four times, which is what an argmax over a flat
/// distribution gives. So the claim is about the checkpoint's numbers and not
/// about the plumbing.
///
/// **A wrong rotary theta does NOT break it.** Rebuilding the ladder at
/// 10_000 instead of the 1_000_000 this model was trained with leaves the
/// continuation exactly right.
///
/// # And then it was held against an oracle
///
/// A numpy forward of the same checkpoint -- reading the safetensors directly,
/// dequantizing MLX's 4-bit groups itself, sharing no code and no kernel with
/// this crate -- answers `[88204, 6100, 41777, 2930]` for this prompt, which
/// is argmax-identical to what the card returns over all four greedy steps.
/// So "the pattern" is no longer the only thing this is checked against: an
/// independent implementation agrees token for token. That is a real limit on what this test proves
/// and it is recorded rather than hidden: over 36 positions both bases give
/// angles a head can tell apart, and induction is a copying circuit that
/// matches on CONTENT. So the rotary claim in the list above is the weaker
/// one -- this would catch a ladder that was not applied at all, or one
/// indexed by the wrong position, but not one merely tuned wrongly.

/// A second real model is served correctly, biases and all.

/// # What one model could not say
///
/// Every real-weight claim in this file was made against one checkpoint, and a
/// driver that had specialised to it -- eight kv heads, a 1024-wide hidden, a
/// qk-norm at every layer -- would pass all of them and serve nothing else. So
/// this serves `mlx-community/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-4bit` through exactly the
/// same helper. It differs in every fact a driver has to get right: **two kv
/// heads instead of eight** (a quarter as wide a cache, 6:1 head grouping
/// rather than 2:1), hidden 1536 rather than 1024, an mlp of 8960 rather than
/// 3072, a FUSED qkv projection, **no qk-norm at all**, and **attention
/// biases**, which nothing else here has -- a different kernel sequence, not
/// merely different sizes. 732 weights against 704.
///
/// # It answered the wrong thing for four commits, and that is the point
///
/// This test used to assert `[5937, 1560, 16925, 43715]` where the pattern
/// wanted `[88204, 6100, 41777, 2930]`, and the difference was three kernels
/// a layer that nobody launched.
///
/// Qwen2.5 has attention biases -- `LlamaLikeFacts::qwen2_5_1_5b` states
/// `qkv_bias: true`, the semantic text and the CUDA text both add
/// `{q,k,v}_proj.bias` to the raw projections, and this checkpoint ships all
/// 84 of them. The shared Metal text ignored the fact entirely, for one
/// reason: `AddBias` lowers to `norm::add_bias_bf16`, no Metal-side kernel
/// added a bias, and a text cannot state an op no kernel implements. So the
/// lowered qwen2.5 decode plan bound 648 weights and not one was a bias, and
/// this driver computed a Qwen2 without them -- correctly, and to the wrong
/// answer.
///
/// # How that stopped being a theory, and then stopped being true
///
/// A CPU reference (`files/qwen-cpu-reference.py` in the session that wrote
/// this: a numpy forward reading the safetensors directly, dequantizing MLX's
/// 4-bit groups itself, sharing no code and no kernel with this crate) was run
/// on the same checkpoint and the same prompt, twice:
///
///   - with the biases:    `[88204, 6100, 41777, 2930]` -- the pattern;
///   - without the biases: `[5937, 1560, 16925, 43715]`.
///
/// The driver matched the second, exactly, four greedy steps deep. That
/// measured the gap instead of arguing it, and it is what the fix was aimed
/// at: a `norm/add_bias` kernel in `kernels-vulkan` AND in `kernels-metal`
/// (coverage is parity, and a text can only name what some kernel on that
/// side implements), `Source::OutWidth` taught to this crate's binder, and a
/// `LlamaLikeMetalFacts::add_bias` capability the text gates the three
/// statements on. The driver now answers the FIRST list.
///
/// The same reference was run on qwen3-0.6B, which has no biases to drop, and
/// agreed with the card there too. So it is an oracle for both models and not
/// a story told about one.
///
/// # Why the biasless answer is still written down
///
/// Because it is the thing this test would produce if the capability were
/// ever quietly turned off -- by a fact set defaulting the other way, by a
/// text that stopped gating on it, by a binder that dropped `OutWidth` and
/// left the run short. Every one of those is a silent wrong answer rather
/// than an error, and none of them changes the shape of anything. Asserting
/// that the answer is the biased one AND is not the biasless one names the
/// regression instead of just failing near it.
///
/// # The controls
///
/// The cache shape is taken from the FACTS rather than from qwen3's numbers,
/// and that is load-bearing: serving qwen2.5 through the eight-head shape is
/// not refused, it just answers differently. The decode plan is fired as well
/// as the prefill one, and the two agree -- which is the claim that would
/// break first if the fused qkv were bound at the wrong width, since prefill
/// and decode state different matmuls.
///
/// And the weights come from `model_loader::executor::Execution` rather than
/// from source spans: this model's plan states 535 `TileMap` transforms for
/// its fused qkv, so the verbatim read that was correct for qwen3 would have
/// handed the card three separate projections.

/// A conversation forked from another answers the way its source does, and a
/// conversation forked from a DIFFERENT one does not.
///
/// # What this is for
///
/// The engine's `copy_kv`. A branch -- a beam, a retry, two continuations of
/// one system prompt -- otherwise pays a second prefill over tokens the cache
/// already holds. Nothing in this driver could move a page until now.
///
/// # What it measures
///
/// Both halves of a fork, which live in two modules on purpose. `Book::fork`
/// seats the destination and returns the moves; `Pool::copy_page` performs
/// them; only `Shell::fork` has both. A fork that seated without copying
/// produces a conversation attending over WHATEVER those pages last held --
/// zeros on a fresh pool, which is finite, plausible and wrong. So the claim
/// is made numerically, over a whole distribution and not an argmax: two rows
/// that agree to the last bit came from the same cache.
///
/// # The controls
///
/// Three, and each rules out something the equality alone would not:
///
/// 1. **A fork of a different source answers differently.** Without it, a
///    driver that copied nothing and left both conversations reading page 0
///    would pass -- every conversation would agree with every other.
/// 2. **The forked conversation and its source then DIVERGE when fed
///    different tokens.** Without it, a fork that aliased the same pages
///    rather than copying them would pass the first assertion perfectly, and
///    two conversations sharing one cache is precisely the bug being ruled
///    out.
/// 3. **Three refusals**: forking onto a seated conversation, forking from an
///    unseated one, and forking onto itself. The first is the dangerous one --
///    it would drop the destination's pages without telling anybody.
///
/// # The mutations
///
/// Five, each on a different line, and all five are refused at the first
/// comparison -- which is the point: every one of them produces a
/// conversation that still answers, finitely and plausibly.
///
/// 1. `Shell::fork` skips the `copy_page` loop entirely.
/// 2. `Book::fork` seats the destination on the SOURCE's pages, aliasing
///    rather than copying. Refused earlier still, by `Frame::of`: `requests 0
///    and 1 both own page 0`. Recorded rather than reworked, because a
///    refusal is a better outcome than a number.
/// 3. `Pool::copy_page` copies layer 0 only.
/// 4. `Pool::copy_page` copies the keys and not the values.
/// 5. `Book::fork` seats the destination at zero tokens rather than the
///    source's count -- so the pages are right and the length is not.
///
/// Nothing here is a survivor.

///
/// # Why this is separate from the fork test
///
/// They are different verbs on the same machinery, and only one of them is
/// the engine's. `Shell::fork` names a CONVERSATION; the engine's prefix
/// cache names PHYSICAL PAGES and has no conversation id to give. A test of
/// one says nothing about the other's arithmetic: the plan states a page and
/// a row offset, and a row offset is a place inside a page that forking never
/// addresses.
///
/// # What it measures
///
/// Against the cache itself, read back, rather than against logits. A logit
/// comparison would say the copy landed SOMEWHERE right; reading the bytes
/// says which bytes. Both cache sides and a middle layer are checked, since
/// copying only layer 0 is a mutation the fork test already showed is
/// invisible to a single layer's numbers.
///
/// # The controls
///
/// 1. **A plan whose last cell names a page past the pool is refused, and the
///    pages named EARLIER in the same plan are unchanged.** This is the whole
///    reason the plan is walked twice. The C++ this replaces applies the page
///    moves first and notices the bad cell afterwards, leaving a cache that
///    is half somebody else's with no way back.
/// 2. **A foreign memory domain is refused by name.** A plan addressed to
///    another backend's memory, served here, would copy the right bytes into
///    the wrong device's pages.
/// 3. **A mismatched page-id count is refused** rather than zipped to the
///    shorter of the two, which would silently drop moves.
///
/// # The mutations
///
/// Five, and one of them was a live survivor until the test was widened --
/// which is why the survivor is recorded rather than quietly fixed.
///
/// 1. The page moves applied BEFORE the cells are checked, which is the C++
///    order. Caught by control 1.
/// 2. A cell copying to the end of its page instead of one row. **Survived**
///    the first version of this test, because the only cell then had offsets
///    3 and 1 and "the rest of the page" was one row anyway. A second cell at
///    offset 0 with three rows behind it, plus the rows-around assertions,
///    catches it.
/// 3. The cell's source and destination swapped.
/// 4. The domain check removed.
/// 5. The page-pairing check removed.

/// The cache can be grown and shrunk under a live conversation without
/// changing a single logit it produces.
///
/// # Why this is the claim
///
/// `driver-metal`'s pool is sparse: it commits and releases pages without
/// moving an address, because Metal binds its heap once. This pool
/// REALLOCATES -- `sparseBinding` is an optional Vulkan feature and this
/// driver's whole premise is running where the optional features are absent.
/// That is only safe because every descriptor here is written during the step
/// that uses it, so no address survives a step for a resize to invalidate.
///
/// That premise is exactly what a test can break. So: prefill a conversation,
/// resize the cache out from under it twice, and require the next token's
/// WHOLE distribution to be bit-identical to the same conversation's on a
/// pool nobody touched. A reallocation that dropped the cache, or copied it
/// at the wrong stride, still answers -- with an argmax that is often still
/// right, which is why the comparison is over every logit.
///
/// # The controls
///
/// 1. **The two runs are the same shell**, one after the other, with the
///    conversation re-seated under a new id. A second shell would compare two
///    devices and two uploads as well as two caches.
/// 2. **A shrink that would drop a held page is refused BY NAME**, saying
///    which conversation and which page -- and the conversation still answers
///    afterwards, so the refusal did not half-apply.
/// 3. **A resize of a pool that is not the KV one is a no-op**, not a
///    refusal: the engine's trim task asks about three pools every tick and
///    two of them hold nothing here.
///
/// # The mutations
///
/// Three, all refused: dropping the copy in `Pool::resize` (the grown cache
/// is zeros); copying `pages` rows instead of `pages * page_size * row`; and
/// letting `Book::resize` shrink past a held page, which strands it and is
/// caught by control 2.

/// | phase | share |
/// |---|---|
/// | `lower` | 0.8-6 ms |
/// | pool stage + state upload | 2.5-6 ms |

/// | ...of which descriptor writes, 452 launches | 0.1 ms |
/// | ...of which building the run list | 0.03 ms |
/// | ...of which recording the command buffer | 0.3 ms |
/// | ...of which **submit and wait on the GPU** | **almost all of it** |
///
/// That table used to be followed by "and still true in proportion". It is
/// not, and remeasuring it is what found the arena defect below. At today's
/// 5.4 ms, release, per phase:
///
/// | phase | then | now |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `lower` | 0.8-6 ms | **0.3 us** |
/// | pool stage | 2.5-6 ms | **3 us** |
/// | state upload | (above) | **0.6 us** |
/// | the arena | 0.2 ms | 0.19 ms |
/// | `fire` | the rest | **5.25 ms, 89%** |
///
/// The two multi-millisecond host phases are gone -- the lowering because it
/// is cached per step, the stage because the pool stopped rewriting tables
/// that had not changed -- and they did not shrink, they collapsed, by three
/// and four orders of magnitude. So the CONCLUSION survived while every
/// number under it stopped being true, which is the failure mode a
/// proportional claim invites.
///
/// The conclusion, restated from the measurement rather than inherited: this
/// crate's own CPU work is now about 0.2 ms of 5.4, and essentially all of
/// that is the arena's allocation. The fire is 89%.
///
/// # What remeasuring it found
///
/// On a DECODE the arena is 326 KB and 0.19 ms, which is where it always was
/// and is dull. On the 384-row prefill in the sibling test it was **35.5 ms
/// of a 167 ms step**, because there the arena is 233 MB -- and it was being
/// zero-filled in system memory and then uploaded whole. See
/// `a_prefills_arena_does_not_cross_the_bus`, and `turns::arena_for` for the
/// route it takes now. The decode profile above could not have found that:
/// the phase is 3% of a decode and 21% of a prefill, and this test only ever
/// looked at the decode.
///
/// # Where the other half went, and four wrong answers on the way
///
/// The device half was 38 ms of the 44, and every kernel in it ran at about
/// 12 GB/s on a card that does roughly a thousand -- the lm_head launch
/// reading its 78 MB of weights, and equally the small launches reading
/// 1.5 MB. The card drew 85 W of 450 at "100% utilisation": resident and
/// stalled.
///
/// Four hypotheses were tested and refuted, and they are recorded because
/// each cost an experiment and because being wrong four times is what
/// eventually pointed at the right thing:
///
/// 1. **Redundant loads in the quantised matvec.** `dot_lane` re-fetches the
///    same packed word once per code -- eight times at 4 bits -- and the
///    scale and bias once per element. Rewriting it around
///    `pie_affine_word_dot`, one word load and one scale per eight MACs,
///    changed the step from 44.4 ms to 44.3 ms. The shader compiler was
///    already hoisting them.
/// 2. **The serial reduction.** `reduce_store` has lane 0 sum 32 shared
///    floats per row while 62 of 64 lanes idle. Deleting the reduction
///    outright -- wrong answers, pure probe -- gave 45.1 ms. It is free.
/// 3. **Barrier serialization.** Every dispatch is separated by a global
///    memory barrier, so no two ever overlap. Removing every barrier -- also
///    wrong answers -- gave 39.6 ms. Worth about 5 ms of 44, real but not the
///    story.
/// 4. **Occupancy in the matvec.** 32 lanes to a row and 64 threads to a
///    workgroup is little to hide memory latency behind. Widening it to 64
///    lanes and 128 threads gave 31.5 ms against 31.8 ms. Nothing.
///
/// The clue was in what all four had in common: 12 GB/s at EVERY launch size
/// and for every kernel, which is not what a shader's decomposition looks
/// like. It is what a bus looks like. `Device::buffer` asked for the first
/// memory type that was `HOST_VISIBLE | HOST_COHERENT` -- and on this card
/// that is type 2, which is system RAM. Every weight, every KV page and every
/// activation lived across PCIe, and 12 GB/s is what PCIe 4.0 x16 gives.
/// Type 4 is `DEVICE_LOCAL` as well, mappable across the whole 24 GB because
/// resizable BAR is on. Preferring it took the step from 31.8 ms to 18.1 ms,
/// and a 1536-token step from 110 ms to 59 ms.
///
/// The kernels were never the ceiling. They may yet be worth improving --
/// nothing above proves they are good, only that they were not what was
/// wrong -- but that is a `kernels-vulkan` question and no longer an urgent
/// one.
///
/// # Why the ceiling is where it is
///
/// 250 ms per step, against 5.4 ms measured in release and 12.0 to 20.1 ms
/// across five debug runs of this suite. Those numbers are not the ones this
/// header carried for most of its life -- it said 18 ms release and about
/// 70 ms debug, from before the wider `QMM_TILE`, the cached per-step
/// lowering and the hazard-analysed barriers landed. A stale figure in a
/// timing note is worse than none: it is what a reader compares against when
/// deciding whether a slowdown is real, and 44 ms would have looked like an
/// improvement.
///
/// The margin is for the shared box rather than the driver, and the spread
/// above is why it stays wide: the same build varies by 1.7x between runs
/// depending on what else holds the card. The number to catch is a stall of
/// seconds, not a slow afternoon, and a tighter bound would be a benchmark --
/// which on a shared machine is a flaky test. 250 ms is twelve times the
/// slowest run observed, which is as tight as that spread allows.

/// -- and a part that grows with the history, which is attention reading
/// every key it has kept. At twenty-four tokens the second part is invisible.
///

///
/// | context | decode step |

/// | 24 | 38.0 ms |
/// | 384 | 100.6 ms |
/// | 1536 | 306.4 ms |

/// 0.177 ms per token of history then, so at a thousand tokens -- an ordinary
/// conversation -- attention was five sixths of every step, and the crate's
/// whole performance story had been written from a twenty-four token prompt
/// where it looked like a rounding error.
///
/// # What that measurement found
///
/// A decode workgroup in `attn/sdpa_paged.slang` has one thread per head
/// dimension, and every one of those threads was walking the entire query and
/// key vectors to arrive at the same scalar score. A hundred and twenty-eight
/// threads computing one number a hundred and twenty-eight times. Having the
/// workgroup add its own terms in a tree instead:
///
/// | context | before | cooperative | and in VRAM |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | 24 | 38.0 ms | 31.8 ms | 18.1 ms |
/// | 384 | 100.6 ms | 49.9 ms | 31.8 ms |
/// | 1536 | 306.4 ms | 110.1 ms | 59.2 ms |
///
/// 0.052 ms per token, and 2.8x faster where it matters; the third column is
/// the memory-type fix `a_decode_step_does_not_stall` describes, which is
/// worth another 1.9x and is a separate finding. Which is why this test
/// exists: the defect was not visible at all from the short context, and
/// nothing would have noticed it coming back.
///
/// # Why the ceiling is where it is, and why 384 and not 1536
///
/// 500 ms, against 15.0 ms measured in release at this context and 21.4 to
/// 32.6 ms across debug runs of this suite. As with the short sibling, the
/// figures this header used to carry -- 31.8 ms release, about 107 ms debug
/// -- predate the `QMM_TILE` widening and the cached lowering, and a stale
/// number in a timing note is what a reader compares a real slowdown
/// against.
///
/// Fifteen times the slowest debug run observed: margin for a shared box
/// rather than for the kernel, and the spread between those runs is itself
/// 1.5x. It would still catch the hundred-and-twenty-eight-fold regression
/// it was written for by a wide margin.
///
/// The context is 384 tokens and not the 1536 the table above measures,
/// because a 1536-token prefill does not finish inside `run_all`'s
/// ten-second fence wait in a debug build with GPU-assisted validation on.
/// That is a property of the layers, not of the driver -- but it is the

/// which is the pair `bootstrap` reads together before it starts a trim task
/// at all, so `Shell::resize_pool` was implemented, contents-preserving and
/// refusal-safe -- proven by
/// `a_cache_resized_under_a_conversation_does_not_change_its_answer` just
/// above -- and never reached in production.
///
/// The seam's first reason for the zero was "nothing can be given back
/// page-wise", which was false: a shrink frees the old buffers and takes
/// smaller ones. The measured reason was better. `Pool::resize` read every
/// layer's whole old buffer down to HOST memory and wrote the survivors back
/// up, through a mapping that reads at ten megabytes a second because
/// mappable VRAM is write-combined. So the charge was the pool twice, and the
/// delta did not enter it:
///
/// | shrink, 256 pages of qwen3-0.6b | cost |
/// |---|---|
/// | 255 -> 254 (one page) | 2.77 s |
/// | 254 -> 128 (126 pages) | 0.74 s |
///
/// Handing back one page cost nearly four times what handing back half the
/// pool cost, because the deeper cut filled a smaller destination. The
/// cheapest trim that pool offered was the largest one.
///
/// That test carried an instruction: it "still fails hard the day the premise
/// changes ... this assertion would go red, and the failure is the reminder
/// to go and advertise what by then would be true." The premise changed on
/// purpose. `Pool::resize` now moves what survives with `vkCmdCopyBuffer` and
/// zero-fills a grow's tail with `vkCmdFillBuffer`, so nothing crosses the
/// bus and no host memory is held. The same two shrinks:
///
/// | shrink | cost |
/// |---|---|
/// | 255 -> 254 (one page) | 20.5 ms |
/// | 254 -> 128 (126 pages) | 18.6 ms |
/// | 128 -> 256 (a grow) | 20.0 ms |
///
/// A hundred and thirty-five times cheaper, and flat rather than inverted:
/// what is left is dominated by taking and binding fifty-six allocations, not
/// by moving bytes. So the seam now advertises both numbers and the trim task
/// runs.
///
/// # What this asserts, and why so loosely
///
/// Two things, both lower bounds, both an order of magnitude clear of the
/// measurement, because this is a shared box behind two validation layers and
/// an assertion that tracked the number would fail whenever the other tenant
/// got busy:
///
/// - a shrink of any depth completes in under 500 ms, which is the property
///   that makes a ten-second trim tick sane. Measured: about 20 ms.
/// - a one-page shrink is not more than four times a half-pool shrink, which
///   is the INVERSION going away. Measured: 1.10x.
///
/// The second is the one that matters, and it is stated as a ratio rather
/// than as two durations so that it says something about the pool rather than
/// about the box. It goes red if a resize ever again charges for the pool
/// instead of for what it keeps.

/// Both directions of the asymmetry, because the fix is not "grow for

///    that reallocated without carrying the contents over is caught too.
/// 2. A SOURCE above the pool is still REFUSED. This pool only ever grows on
///    demand, so a page it has never held is a page nothing has ever written;
///    growing for it would turn a refusal into a copy of fresh zeros, which
///    is history-shaped silence rather than an error.
///
/// # Mutations this kills
///
/// * The growth removed: the first copy is refused with the sweep's message.
/// * `need` taken over sources as well as destinations: the second half
///   returns `Ok` and the refusal is gone.
/// * The growth done with `resize` to `need` but the pool rebuilt empty: the

///
/// `Modules::code` used to take only a symbol, and every module store here is
/// keyed by file stem, so the cooperative-matrix build of an entrypoint --
/// stored under `<symbol>.coopmat` -- was named by nothing and loaded by
/// nobody. All 146 of them were dead. `serve.rs` carries that story; this is
/// the consequence for testing.
///
/// Turning them on is not a small change. It swaps the arithmetic of the
/// largest kernel family in the tree for a different one: a subgroup matrix
/// unit with `float16_t` A and B operands, accumulating through shared
/// memory. `kernels-vulkan` checks that kernel against its own baseline in
/// isolation, which is worth having and is not the same claim as this one --
/// a kernel can be right about a matrix and wrong about which bytes of a real
/// quantised weight it was handed.
///
/// And the existing suite could not have caught it. Every other test here
/// runs at the tile the shared model code states, `(16, 32)`, and 16 is the
/// one row tile `quant/qmm_t.slang` deliberately does NOT compile a
/// cooperative-matrix module for. **The whole device suite passed with the
/// tier switched on and exercised precisely zero of it.** This is the only
/// place in this crate where a cooperative-matrix module runs against a real
/// model at all.
///
/// # What is held fixed
///
/// The tile and the tier are two knobs and this moves ONE. Both runs of a
/// pair state the same tile, and the control gets a module store with every
/// `<symbol>.<tag>` key removed, so it falls back to the scalar module on
/// the same device, over the same weights, through the same launches.
/// Comparing `(16, 32)` against `(32, 32)` instead would have changed the
/// batching and the grid as well, and any difference would have been
/// unattributable.
///
/// Both tiles that HAVE a cooperative-matrix build are covered, 32 and 64,
/// because the reason to care about this claim is mostly the case for
/// widening `QMM_TILE` -- and 64 is the width the prefill measurement in
/// `crates/model` points at. The two tiles agree on the error to the last
/// digit reported below, which is itself worth something: the discrepancy is
/// the operand format and not the tiling.
///
/// # Why this is a tolerance and not an equality
///
/// It was written as an equality first, on the strength of `qmm_t.slang`'s
/// header saying the dequantisation is kept byte-for-byte identical. It is --
/// and the MULTIPLY is not. The scalar path multiplies in fp32; the matrix
/// unit takes `float16_t` operands. So the two disagree by a little, and the
/// question is only how much.
///
/// Measured over qwen3-0.6b's 151,936 logits, at both tiles: **greatest
/// difference 0.25, mean 0.036, against a largest logit of 25.6** -- and the
/// same argmax. The
/// bound below is 0.5, twice the observed error; the run is deterministic --
/// same weights, same prompt, same launches -- so the margin is there for a
/// different device's matrix unit rounding differently, not for run-to-run
/// noise.
///
/// The argmax assertion is the one that matters. A sampler reads the
/// ranking, and a tier that changed which token won would be a different

/// never the argument, and the cost was the whole problem: this card's
/// mappable VRAM is write-combined, so the load side of that `memmove` runs
/// uncached at some thirty megabytes a second. `Pool::copy_plan` calls this
/// once per layer per half for every page the engine moves, so a prefix share
/// and a fork both paid it. It is the same defect `Pool::resize` had, and it
/// outlived that fix by hiding behind a doc comment that explained why the
/// host route was correct without ever asking what it cost.
///
/// # What it measures
///
/// Both routes, against a host-computed expectation, and both edges of the
/// choice between them:
///
/// 1. **Disjoint** ranges, which take the copy engine -- every move a pool
///    actually makes, because a page move names two different pages.
/// 2. **Overlapping** ranges, which must keep the documented `memmove`
///    promise. A `vkCmdCopyBuffer` whose regions overlap within one buffer is
///    undefined, so this is the case the mapping is retained for; if the
///    disjointness test were ever written backwards, this is what says so.
/// 3. **The cost**, as an order-of-magnitude tripwire and not a benchmark. A
///    megabyte took 33 ms through the mapping and 27 us on the copy engine,
///    so a 15 ms ceiling is comfortably clear of the fixed route and nowhere
///    near the variable one. It started at 5 ms and was raised once, after a
///    full-suite run on a contended box tripped it while the same test passed
///    solo twice: the copy engine's cost is a SUBMISSION, so it moves with
///    whatever else is submitting, and 15 ms still leaves the host route --
///    which contention would only slow further -- caught by more than double.
///
/// The overlap is deliberately a FORWARD one -- destination above source,
/// overlapping by half -- because that is the direction a naive byte-at-a-time
/// copy corrupts, and `std::ptr::copy` is the reason it does not.

/// `Shell::copy_kv` had this defect and was fixed one commit earlier; this is

/// `kv_translation` and `required_kv_pages` -- both of which are the engine's
/// STATEMENTS about the pages -- and not from `kv_page_indices`, which is the
/// list the driver actually binds. The two can differ: the translation is
/// empty whenever nothing was moved, and only one of the engine's two
/// batch-assembly paths folds the page list into the declared high-water.
///
/// Measured on a three-page pool, before the fix:
///
/// ```text
///   a step of this frame did not run:
///   Unstageable(NoSuchPage { request: 0, page: 7, pages: 3 })
/// ```
///
/// That is not a silent wrong answer -- the bounds check in `Request::stage`
/// caught it, which is why it stays exactly where it is. It is a REQUEST
/// KILLED for a page the scheduler was entitled to hand out and the pool
/// could have grown to hold, which is the same fault the copy door had and
/// the same one `admit` exists to prevent.
///
/// # What is measured
///
/// The growth, its size, and the ANSWER -- the same decode fired on the same
/// page 7 from a pool that started with room for it. A growth that reallocated
/// without carrying the pool's contents, or that renumbered the pages, gives
/// a different row.
