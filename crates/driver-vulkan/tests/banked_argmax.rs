//! **THE WHOLE CHAIN, ON A REAL CARD: a cached checkpoint through this driver
//! to an argmax, against the answer cuda banked.**
//!
//! `crates/driver-cuda/tests/banked_argmaxes.rs` is what this is measured
//! against and its header is the history: three checkpoints, one token in, an
//! argmax and a logit banked from the first end-to-end fire each SKU ever
//! managed. `driver-wgpu/tests/banked_argmax.rs` is the sibling on the other
//! shader plane and answers two of the three.
//!
//! # Why gpt-oss and not the small one
//!
//! `qwen35-d0.8b` is a third the size and eight times faster to load, and it
//! is not the row this plane can answer first. It is a HYBRID: eighteen of
//! its twenty-four layers are gated DeltaNet and want a recurrent slab each,
//! and **`driver-vulkan` allocates no recurrent slab anywhere** —
//! `resources` has a `Pool` and no `RecurrentPool`, and `Pools::slab` has
//! answered `None` for every layer since it was written. Standing a fixture
//! up for one would mean this test inventing a layout that no allocator on
//! this plane owns, and a layout invented by its own test is a layout that
//! agrees with itself.
//!
//! `gptoss-20b-bf16-mxfp4-kv-bf16` needs none: twenty-four layers of
//! attention, all one width, no recurrence at all. What it needs instead is
//! everything else this plane had never been asked for — a sink on every
//! layer, alternating sliding and full attention, mxfp4 experts, and twelve
//! gigabytes of weights against an adapter that binds four.
//!
//! # What this asks that nothing else in this crate does
//!
//! `tests/the_walk_is_the_program.rs` asks whether the walk visits the right
//! steps with a recorder standing where a device would. `tests/device.rs`
//! takes ONE `norm.rmsnorm` through the same `serve::run` this uses.
//! `tests/device_{fire,gemm,ssm,sink}.rs` each ask whether a family computes
//! the right numbers on the card. Every one of those is one link. This is the
//! chain:
//!
//! > weights produced → uploaded → pools allocated → a `Program` walked →
//! > every statement fired → logits read → argmax compared.
//!
//! # What walking a whole tower found here
//!
//! **This driver dropped every `InOut` copy on the floor.** The walk has
//! recorded them since it was written (`walk::fire::Fire::inout`): a point
//! that reads an operand and writes a result gets two rectangles whenever
//! `model_compiler::program::carve` gives the result its own slot, and the
//! operand's bytes have to be moved into it first. `serve::run` took
//! `dispatches` and not `blits`, so the kernel read whatever that slot held.
//!
//! Nothing in the tree could see it, and the reason is exact: `serve::run` is
//! this plane's device half and **had never been called with a real plan.**
//! Its one caller fires a `norm.rmsnorm`, which is not an `InOut` point. This
//! fire states 240 of them.
//!
//! # Why the answer is falsifiable
//!
//! Because the comparison is against a number this tree did not compute. A
//! self-consistency check — this plane against itself, or against an f64
//! model of what its shaders do — would pass for a tower that agreed with
//! itself and disagreed with the model. 11 at 14.4375 came off a CUDA card
//! through `kernels-cuda`, and the only thing the two planes share is the
//! model TEXT.
//!
//! `PHYSICAL_PAGE` is the other half: the fire's one token is written to and
//! read from PHYSICAL PAGE 3, not page 0, so a driver that bound the pool and
//! ignored the translation planes would attend over zeros.
//!
//! # The skip
//!
//! This plane has no `driver_wgpu::skip`, so the convention is
//! `tests/device_gemm.rs`'s: print the word and return. It is stated here
//! rather than borrowed, because the two halves are different questions and a
//! reader should see which one was absent — a CARD, a SHADER TREE, or a
//! CHECKPOINT.

/// `rope.yarn` (a precomputed ladder nothing stages), op 22
/// `mlp.swiglu_clamp_alpha` (no strided arm for a packed row), op 24
/// `moe.weighted_sum` (only the sorted fold, which needs a permutation no
/// point of this plane writes). `tests/doors.rs` held each against its
/// sentence and now holds all four fired.
///
/// **THE BISECT IS HERE NOW**, in the form the other two planes have:
/// `PIE_STOP_AFTER` cuts the dispatch list and `PIE_VULKAN_DUMP_SLOTS` prints
/// every rectangle as mean, rms and max — the same lines `driver-wgpu`

///
/// ```text
///   19  norm.add_bias           AGREE  rel 0.0000
///   20  moe.topk_softmax        was the first divergence, TWICE
///   22  mlp.swiglu_clamp_alpha  AGREE  rel 0.0000
///   23  moe.matmul_select_bias  DIFFER rel 0.28  — where it stands
/// ```
///
/// `moe.topk_softmax` was wrong in two independent ways and each hid behind
/// the other: it normalised the softmax over ALL thirty-two experts instead of
/// the four it kept, and it fired the `PIE_ACT` weight arm at a slot the point
/// declares `f32`. The EXPERTS CHOSEN were identical throughout — only the
/// weight plane beside them moved.
///
/// `moe.matmul_select_bias` then passed `x_slot_stride = 0` unconditionally,
/// which is right for an activation with one row per TOKEN and wrong for one
/// with a row per ROUTE. gpt-oss hands it the second, so all four experts
/// contracted against route zero's activations. `activation_strides` derives
/// the pair now, as `kernels-wgpu`'s `selected` always has.
/// Open a device, fire one banked row's lane, and compare — or say plainly

///
