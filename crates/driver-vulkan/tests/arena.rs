//! Can a Vulkan driver bind the arena a real lowering assigns?
//!
//! Every other test in this crate asks about a module or a dispatch. This one
//! asks about the OFFSETS, and it is the precondition the whole arena plan
//! rests on: `model_compiler::lower` places each activation at a byte offset it
//! chooses, `driver-metal` binds those offsets with `setBuffer:offset:` and
//! Apple silicon asks four bytes of alignment for it -- so nothing upstream has
//! ever had a reason to place them more carefully than that.
//!
//! Vulkan asks more. A storage descriptor's offset must be a multiple of
//! `minStorageBufferOffsetAlignment`, and an offset that is not simply cannot
//! be bound: there is no slow path and no fallback, the descriptor is invalid.
//! If the compiler placed activations at, say, four-byte boundaries, this
//! backend could not use the arena at all and would need a copy per operand --
//! which is a different driver, not a slower one.
//!
//! So it is worth knowing rather than assuming, and it is worth knowing
//! against the SPECIFICATION rather than against the card in this machine.
//!
//! # The answer is exactly enough, with nothing to spare
//!
//! `lower`'s arena allocator rounds every placement to 256 bytes, on both its
//! bump path and its free-list path. 256 is also the largest
//! `minStorageBufferOffsetAlignment` a conformant Vulkan device may report. So
//! every offset every text produces is bindable on every device -- and the
//! margin is ZERO.
//!
//! It reads like a designed agreement and it is not one. That allocator's
//! comment says why it picked the number: *"a decode body runs inside a
//! capture, so the same plan must land the same value at the same address on
//! every fire"*. It is a Metal capture-replay requirement that happens to
//! coincide with a Vulkan descriptor limit, in a crate that has never heard of
//! either.
//!
//! Which is the entire reason this file exists. A coincidence nobody wrote
//! down is a coincidence somebody may reasonably undo -- and the first
//! measurement here, taken over one text, reported a comfortable 2048 and
//! would have let a change to 128 look harmless. It was `gpt_oss_20b` that
//! gave the real answer: a 2880-wide row of 2 bytes is 5760, which is not a
//! multiple of 256, so the next operand lands at 5888 and the alignment is
//! whatever the allocator insists on and nothing more.
//!
//! GPU-free on purpose. The question is about numbers a compiler produced, and
//! a check that needed a device would not run in the builds that change them.
