//! VULKAN's kernel signature table — one row per KERNEL in `kernels/`, and one
//! row is many entrypoints.
//!
//! ## Why this is shaped like Metal's and not like CUDA's
//!
//! `kernels-cuda` has one row per launcher symbol, because a CUDA launcher is
//! an authored C++ function and there is nothing else it could be. A GLSL
//! compute shader is the other extreme: it has exactly ONE entry point and it
//! is always called `main`, so a name like
//! `affine_qmm_t_bfloat16_gs_64_b_4_bm_32_bn_32` cannot be a symbol at all. It
//! is the name of a SPIR-V MODULE — one `.spv`, compiled from one `.comp` with
//! one `-D` set, exactly as llama.cpp's `vulkan-shaders-gen` produces its
//! `matmul_q4_k_f16_f32.spv` and its 900 siblings.
//!
//! That lands this table on Metal's shape rather than CUDA's, for nearly
//! Metal's reason: an entrypoint here is GENERATED from a template evaluated at
//! a point, so enumerating the product by hand would state the generator's job
//! a second time. A row carries its [`Axis`]es and the product is the
//! entrypoint set.
//!
//! **The coverage is `kernels-metal`'s, deliberately.** Row for row, axis for
//! axis, point for point: 99 kernels over 480 entrypoints, the same names in
//! the same ten families. That is not imitation for its own sake — it is what
//! makes the two backends comparable. `model-compiler` checks a lowered plan
//! against whichever table the deployment selected, so a text that runs on
//! Metal either runs here or names exactly which row it wanted; and a
//! divergence between the two tables is then a STATEMENT that one backend
//! covers something the other does not, rather than an accident nobody wrote
//! down.
//!
//! ## The Vulkan launch ABI, which is this backend's one real divergence
//!
//! A Metal row is positional over BUFFERS: `constant int& n [[buffer(4)]]` is a
//! buffer like any other, so a scalar and a tensor occupy the same kind of slot
//! and the row's index is the binding. Vulkan does not work that way. Binding a
//! four-byte scalar as a storage buffer costs a descriptor write, a device
//! allocation and a barrier for a number that fits in a push constant, and no
//! Vulkan backend written by anyone does it — llama.cpp puts every scalar in
//! one `layout(push_constant)` block and every tensor in a `binding`.
//!
//! So the row is read in TWO passes, and the rule is mechanical:
//!
//! * every operand whose [`kernels::Ty`] is a BUFFER kind (`Buf`, `BufMut`,
//!   `I32s`, `U32s`, `U8s`, `F32s`, and the rest of the pointer family) takes
//!   the next `layout(std430, binding = N)` slot, in row order, from 0;
//! * every operand whose kind is a SCALAR (`I32`, `U32`, `F32`, `Usize`,
//!   `Bool`, `InPacked`) takes the next field of the single
//!   `layout(push_constant)` block, in row order.
//!
//! Both passes read the SAME row in the SAME order, so nothing about which
//! operand is which moves; only where the value rides does. [`bindings`] is the
//! rule as code, so a shell binding a launch and a test checking a shader
//! compute it from one place rather than agreeing by habit.
//!
//! The rule is stated here rather than per-row on purpose: it is a property of
//! the API, not of any kernel, and a table that spelled it 99 times would let
//! row 100 spell it differently.
//!
//! ## What keeps it honest
//!
//! Three checks, at three distances — the same three the Metal tree has, with
//! the middle one doing more work because the generator is ours:
//!
//! * `kernels`' own unit tests pin the matcher — that a row covers every point
//!   of its axes and refuses a partial or permuted spelling.
//! * `tests/entrypoints.rs` pins the table's product against
//!   `entrypoints.generated.txt`.
//! * `scripts/vulkan-kernel-audit.py` pins that file against the shaders, by
//!   reading the `// pie:instantiate` directives the BUILD compiles from — so
//!   the audit and the build cannot disagree about what exists — and
//!   `--compile` runs `glslc` over every one of them, which proves a declared
//!   variant is a variant that builds.
//!
//! And from the other end, `model-compiler`'s `kernels::check_plan` refuses any
//! launched symbol no row declares, so a lowered text cannot state a kernel
//! this table has not heard of.
//!
//! ## The validation layer, which is not optional and is not installed
//!
//! Everything above is a comparison between two descriptions. Whether a DRIVER
//! agrees is a separate question, and the driver these were developed against
//! answers a malformed request by building the pipeline anyway. Three real
//! defects survived a green suite for weeks because of it: the coopmat tier
//! not naming `vulkanMemoryModel`, the baseline tier requiring an optional
//! `shaderInt64`, and 120 entrypoints declaring a push block wider than the
//! range their row builds.
//!
//! `tests/gpu.rs` enables `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` when the loader can see
//! it, with synchronization and GPU-assisted validation on, and an ERROR ends
//! the process. It is a soft dependency, because a build machine will not have
//! the layer and "no validation here" must not be a test failure — which does
//! mean a clean CI run is weaker evidence than a clean local one.
//!
//! It does not have to be installed system-wide. `apt-get download
//! vulkan-validationlayers`, `dpkg-deb -x` it somewhere, rewrite the
//! manifest's `library_path` to the absolute path of the extracted `.so`, and
//! point `VK_LAYER_PATH` at the directory holding the manifest.
//!
//! ## What a shell that RUNS these has to do
//!
//! There is no `driver-vulkan` yet, so these are written down here rather than
//! discovered by whoever writes one. All three are things a shader cannot
//! check for itself.
//!
//! * **Grids are workgroup-granular.** `vkCmdDispatch` counts WORKGROUPS where
//!   Metal's `dispatchThreads` counts threads, so a shell that ports a Metal
//!   grid arithmetically will round UP and launch invocations with no work.
//!   Every pointwise body here guards its own tail against the bound length of
//!   the buffer it writes, so an overshoot is harmless. An UNDERSHOOT is not,
//!   and it is the direction that fails silently: a lane that never launches
//!   writes nothing, the gap reads back as whatever the buffer held, and the
//!   dispatch completes. `KernelSig::grid_param`, `head_param` and
//!   `heads_param` say which of the STATEMENT's params give the shape, and a
//!   shell that builds a grid from the fire's numbers instead gets a wrong
//!   answer on any deployment that states two head shapes.
//! * **Enable `robustBufferAccess` unless there is a reason not to.** It makes
//!   an out-of-range access defined and discarded rather than undefined, which
//!   turns the worst residual class of shader bug from memory corruption into
//!   a wrong number. The GPU tests enable it and say plainly that doing so
//!   makes the tail guards unobservable -- the guards are there for a shell
//!   that turns it off.
//! * **One tensor, one descriptor.** Index arithmetic in these shaders is
//!   32-bit, which is safe because
//!   `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits::maxStorageBufferRange` is a `uint32_t` and so a
//!   bound range is at most 4 GiB - 1. A shell that means to address more than
//!   that has a binding problem to solve, not a shader to change.
//! * **An UNSTATED row does not describe a layout, and mistaking that for an
//!   empty one is fatal.** 56 of the 99 rows name no operands.
//!   [`buffer_count`] answers 0 for them honestly -- the row describes nothing
//!   -- but the shader behind the name still declares its bindings, so a
//!   layout built from such a row is missing every descriptor the module
//!   reads. That is not a request a driver rejects: on the machine this was
//!   written against it is a segmentation fault inside
//!   `vkCreateComputePipelines`.
//!
//!   It does NOT mean those 292 entrypoints are unlaunchable, which is what
//!   this said first. `driver-metal/src/lowering/dispatch.rs` shows the other
//!   source: where `sig.operands.is_empty()`, it falls back to the lowered
//!   plan's own argument order. The row's operand list is a reordering and
//!   verification layer over the plan, not the only description of it, and a
//!   Vulkan shell has the same fallback -- it needs a descriptor COUNT at
//!   layout time, and the plan has one. What a shell must not do is build a
//!   layout from the row and dispatch anyway.
//!
//! ## Reading this without a GPU, and without a Vulkan SDK
//!
//! All of the above runs anywhere. `default-features = false` gives the table
//! and nothing else — which is what `model-compiler` wants and all it wants —
//! and `native` adds the `glslc` pass that turns the GLSL tree into SPIR-V.
//! Unlike Metal, that pass is not optional for a shell that means to RUN:
//! `vkCreateShaderModule` takes words, not source.
