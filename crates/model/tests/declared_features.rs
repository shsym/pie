//! A library's declared features must cover what its library code uses.
//!
//! # The trap
//!
//! Cargo unifies a crate's dependency features with its DEV-dependency
//! features for any build that resolves dev targets. So a crate whose library
//! says `model = { features = ["contract"] }` and whose dev-dependency says
//! `features = ["config", "contract", "forward"]` compiles perfectly under
//! `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` and every other
//! command anyone runs — while the library ALONE, which is what a downstream
//! consumer links, does not build at all.
//!
//! `cargo tree -e features,no-dev` shows the truth. Nothing else does, and
//! nothing in CI runs it.
//!
//! # Found three times
//!
//! | where | declared | actually needed |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `model::deployment_cuda` | ungated | `all(forward, config)` |
//! | `model::descriptor` | ungated | `config` |
//! | `driver-cuda` -> `model` | `["config"]`, then `["contract"]` | all three |
//!
//! Two of those three modules no longer exist and neither does the
//! `config` feature — the catalog refactor deleted all of it. The table
//! stays because the LESSON is about the resolver, not about those
//! modules: the same trap is available to `model::catalog`'s
//! `forward`-gated methods the moment a consumer forgets to name the
//! aspect, and the gates are read from `lib.rs` rather than listed here
//! precisely so this test keeps working across that kind of change.
//!
//! The third is the one this file exists for, because it was got wrong
//! TWICE — once by omission and once by a fix that replaced the missing
//! feature instead of adding to it — and both times the workspace was green.
//! CI's `cargo test --workspace` excludes `driver-cuda`, so the one command
//! that could have observed it is the one command that cannot.
//!
//! # What is checked
//!
//! For each consumer: every `model::<root>` path appearing in its `src/` must
//! have its gate satisfied by the features that consumer's LIBRARY dependency
//! on `model` declares. The gates are read from `model/src/lib.rs` rather
//! than listed here, so adding a `#[cfg]` to a module updates this test by
//! itself.
//!
//! # What is NOT checked
//!
//! Only `model`, only its direct consumers listed below, and only the root
//! module of each path. A feature-gated item INSIDE an ungated module is
//! invisible here. That is a deliberate floor: the three instances found were
//! all whole modules, and a check that tried to be complete would need to be
//! the compiler.
