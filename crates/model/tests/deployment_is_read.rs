//! Every `Deployment` field is read by somebody, or says who will.
//!
//! A `Deployment` is what a driver reads a checkpoint's shape off. It
//! is the one place a family's measurements become a driver's
//! instructions, so a field here is a promise that something acts on
//! it. A field nothing reads is not inert: it reads, to whoever adds
//! the next family, as an axis already handled.
//!
//! `k_eq_v` is why this file exists. gemma-4-31b ships no `v_proj` —
//! its full layers read V out of the K projection — and the row states
//! that, and the projection carries it here, and the Metal text acts on
//! it through `LlamaLikeMetalFacts::v_from_k`. The CUDA text never grew
//! an arm: `Gemma4LayerW` declares a `v_proj` and matmuls it with
//! nothing to branch on, and `project::trace` is not even handed the
//! flag. So this field was read by exactly one thing — a
//! `DecodeGeometry` copy that nothing downstream read — and when that
//! copy went, the statement had no reader at all.
//!
//! The refusal in `Variant::trace`'s CUDA arm is what this build can
//! honestly do about it. This test is so the NEXT such field is a
//! failure rather than an archaeology.
