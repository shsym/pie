//! Every catalog row against the checkpoint it claims to be, number for
//! number.
//!
//! This is the safety net for the whole refactor, and it is the same
//! technique the repo already trusts: `tests/differential.rs` held the
//! Rust normalizer to the C++ one it replaced, over this exact corpus,
//! and that is what made deleting the C++ tree a mechanical act rather
//! than a leap. The 58 configs come back here as the oracle for a second
//! replacement.
//!
//! # THE ORACLE IS THE CHECKPOINT'S OWN WORDS
//!
//! It began as a differential against `deployment_cuda::deployment_from`
//! — the eleven per-family derivations this refactor deletes — and that
//! was the right oracle while both existed. It is the WRONG one now,
//! and not merely because the subject is deleted: the derivation and
//! the row would have been two readings of the same `config.json`, so
//! agreement would have proved they were transcribed alike, never that
//! either was RIGHT.
//!
//! So the oracle is the file. For every corpus `config.json` a row
//! claims, every number the config states is compared against the row's
//! answer to the same question. `hidden_size: 1024` in the file and
//! `hidden: 1024` in the row, or the test fails and names both.
//!
//! This is the machinery honest-cost 2 of the design asked for. A
//! `config.json` is at least SELF-CONSISTENT — it is what the
//! checkpoint says about itself — and moving those numbers into `const`
//! rows means a typo becomes a quietly wrong model. Manifest matching
//! catches a typo that contradicts a TENSOR; this catches one that
//! contradicts the publisher. Between them there is nowhere for a
//! mistyped digit to hide.
//!
//! # What a failure means
//!
//! Not "the test is wrong". A row is a set of constants transcribed
//! from a published checkpoint, and a mismatch is a transcription
//! error until proven otherwise. The rare other case — the row is
//! right and the config is describing something else, as when a
//! `head_dim` is absent and implied — is handled by naming the field
//! here rather than by loosening the comparison.
//!
//! # What it does NOT check
//!
//! Rows with no config in the corpus. The corpus is 58 files and the
//! catalog is larger, because a corpus is what someone happened to dump
//! and a catalog is what the tree claims to serve. Coverage of the
//! corpus is asserted below; coverage of the catalog is the manifest's
//! job, not this file's.
