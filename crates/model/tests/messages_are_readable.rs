//! Every message an operator reads is one an operator can read.
//!
//! # The slip this catches
//!
//! A refusal or panic message long enough to wrap gets written as a
//! multi-line string. Rust has two ways to spell that, and only one is
//! right:
//!
//! ```text
//! "the row ships no v_proj \        <- the backslash eats the newline
//!      and the text projects one"      AND the indent. Correct.
//!
//! "the row ships no v_proj
//!      and the text projects one"   <- keeps BOTH. The operator reads
//!                                      five words, twenty spaces, and
//!                                      five more.
//! ```
//!
//! and a third way that is neither: an editor or a script joining the
//! two source lines, which drops the newline and leaves the indent
//! behind. That is what produced every site this test was written
//! against — nine of them, across six crates, each a message someone
//! would eventually read out of a log with a run of spaces jammed
//! through the middle of a sentence.
//!
//! # Why a test and not a lint
//!
//! Nothing else looks. `rustfmt` does not reformat inside a string
//! literal, on purpose — it cannot know whether the spaces are
//! meaningful. `clippy` has no lint for it. And the compiler is
//! perfectly happy: the string is well-formed, it is just wrong about
//! what it says. A garbled message is the one defect class that gets
//! LESS attention the worse it gets, because the reader assumes the
//! garbling is the log's fault.
//!
//! # What it does NOT flag
//!
//! Runs of spaces that are doing work: alignment inside a table, an
//! ASCII diagram, an indent in a `{:>width$}` template. The predicate
//! is narrow on purpose — a run of six or more spaces landing between
//! two pieces of ORDINARY PROSE (lowercase word, spaces, letter). A
//! table's cells are rarely that, and a diagram's are never.
