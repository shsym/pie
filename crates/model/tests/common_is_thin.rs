//! The shared root names no family — and stays thin enough that it cannot.
//!
//! The rule the crate's lib.rs opens with: *"What every family shares: vocabulary and
//! building blocks, never knowledge about any one family."* A rule stated only
//! in prose is one a hurried change can break without anyone noticing, and
//! this one breaks quietly: a family name reaching the shared root does not
//! fail a build, it just moves a fact one directory away from the checkpoints
//! it is about, where the next family to need something similar will copy it.
//!
//! This was `model`, a crate. It is now the `.rs` files at the root
//! of `src/`, and the guard got MORE work rather than less: with no crate
//! boundary to say what is shared, every root file must be classified as
//! shared vocabulary or as something else, and an unclassified one fails.
//!
//! Two things are checked, because "thin" has two failure modes:
//!
//! 1. **No family names.** Not in code, not in a test fixture. A helper that
//!    takes a family's name to *quote it in a diagnostic* is fine — that is a
//!    string the caller supplies — but `common/` may not write one down.
//! 2. **No family-shaped API.** A function whose name contains a family is a
//!    family's rule wearing a shared function's clothes.
//!
//! What this deliberately does NOT check is size. `builder.rs` is the biggest
//! file in the crate and that is correct: it is the authoring DSL, and every
//! generation calls its passes directly. Bulk in a shared crate is only a
//! smell when it is *knowledge*; the passes are mechanism.
//!
//! The generation directories are what tell it what a family is called, so the
//! needle list is derived rather than typed out.
