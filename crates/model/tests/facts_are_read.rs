//! EVERY FACT A FAMILY DECLARES, READ BY THAT FAMILY'S TEXT.
//!
//! A fact is a promise that something about a deployment changes what the
//! model does. A fact nobody reads is a promise nobody keeps, and it
//! fails in the worst available way: the declaration looks complete, the
//! plan traces, and the answer is wrong on the axis the fact was supposed
//! to control.
//!
//! gemma-2 is why this file exists. It carried `tied_embeddings: true`,
//! correctly — the checkpoint ships no `lm_head.weight` — and its text
//! named `"lm_head"` unconditionally, because the
//! `if tied { "embed" } else { "lm_head" }` fork was written in four
//! other family texts and not in that one. The trace asked the binder for
//! a tensor that does not exist. Nothing caught it: the family is in
//! `NOT_YET_OPENABLE`, so no fire reaches it, and a golden pins whatever
//! the text says rather than what it should say.
//!
//! So this is the same closed-set discipline `UNARMED` and
//! `NOT_YET_OPENABLE` use, applied to facts: the unread set is STATED,
//! and a fact that joins it fails here rather than on a checkpoint.
//!
//! The scan is source-level, like `executor_bind`'s arm scan, and for the
//! same reason — the question is about what the code SAYS, and there is
//! no runtime handle on "did this field influence the trace".
//!
//! # Where a declaration lives
//!
//! It used to be `<family>/forward/facts.rs` and only that. The catalog
//! refactor moved the SHAPE up to `<family>/spec.rs` — ungated, because a
//! `const` catalog row is written in those words and a row must exist
//! under every aspect — and left `forward/facts.rs` behind as a re-export
//! plus whatever per-backend facts are genuinely about the tracer.
//!
//! So the scan reads BOTH, and it has to. A re-export file declares no
//! `pub struct`, so a scan that still looked only there would find an
//! empty declared set for every migrated family, agree with an empty
//! stated list, and pass — which is the same failure as the one this file
//! exists to catch, wearing the test's own clothes. A test that quietly
//! stops testing is worse than no test, because the list at the top keeps
//! claiming the set is known.

/// kimi-k2's `rope_yarn_original` shows that shape: its text has no rope

/// `gemma_2` was the OTHER kind, and it is the reason this list is a

/// ignored one axis, which is exactly the defect the file is named for.
/// `gemma_4` was the second of that kind and left when its Metal
/// projection started stating the top-k its text routes on.
///
/// Both are gone now. `gemma_2: attn_logit_softcap` left last, and it
/// took four moves rather than one, which is what that kind costs: the
/// fact was a real measurement, its doc correctly said the attention
/// kernel takes the cap as a dispatch parameter, the kernel really does
/// take it — and `AttnCtx::logits_soft_cap` was the literal `0.0`. So
/// `Deployment` gained `attn_logit_softcap`, gemma-2's projection states
