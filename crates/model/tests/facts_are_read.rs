//! EVERY FACT A FAMILY DECLARES, READ BY THAT FAMILY'S TEXT.
//!
//! A fact is a promise that something about a deployment changes what the
//! model does. A fact nobody reads is a promise nobody keeps, and it
//! fails in the worst available way: the declaration looks complete, the
//! plan traces, and the answer is wrong on the axis the fact was supposed
//! to control.
//!
//! gemma-2 is why this file exists. It carried `tied_embeddings: true`,
//! correctly — the checkpoint ships no `lm_head.weight` — and its text
//! named `"lm_head"` unconditionally, because the
//! `if tied { "embed" } else { "lm_head" }` fork was written in four
//! other family texts and not in that one. The trace asked the binder for
//! a tensor that does not exist. Nothing caught it: the family is in
//! `NOT_YET_OPENABLE`, so no fire reaches it, and a golden pins whatever
//! the text says rather than what it should say.
//!
//! So this is the same closed-set discipline `UNARMED` and
//! `NOT_YET_OPENABLE` use, applied to facts: the unread set is STATED,
//! and a fact that joins it fails here rather than on a checkpoint.
//!
//! The scan is source-level, like `executor_bind`'s arm scan, and for the
//! same reason — the question is about what the code SAYS, and there is
//! no runtime handle on "did this field influence the trace".
