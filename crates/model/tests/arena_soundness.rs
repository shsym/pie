//! THE HOST ASSIGNS BUFFERS. This is the test that makes that safe.
//!
//! Two allocators existed. `Buffers::assign` here, over the traced plan,
//! and `declared::ValueArena` in the CUDA driver, over the same plan at
//! fire time. Keeping both means they must agree byte-for-byte forever,
//! and they already do not: the driver's copy predates `Select`, the
//! `kernel!` in-place table and `Dim::MoeAlignedRoutes`, so on a text
//! using any of the three it would size or place a value differently —
//! silently, because an allocator that hands back a plausible pointer
//! reports nothing.
//!
//! So the host wins and the driver stops allocating: a rectangle's
//! operand already crosses as `Arg::Arena { at, width }`, which is an
//! address, and `Lowered::arena_bytes` is the block it must fit. That
//! makes this file the load-bearing one — a driver that only adds `at`
//! to a base pointer cannot notice an assignment that overlaps, so the
//! overlap has to be impossible HERE.
//!
//! The check is a write trace. Walk the ops in order; stamp each
//! output's byte range with its value; before an op reads an input,
//! demand that the input's range still carries its own stamp. A value
//! placed over a buffer somebody still reads shows up as a stamp that
//! changed underneath its reader.
//!
//! ALIASING is the wrinkle, and it is intended rather than accidental in
//! exactly two places: a `Select` output IS a window of its operand, and
//! an in-place launcher's output IS the operand it accumulates into.
//! Both are unions, so the trace stamps by the union's ROOT and the
//! intended sharing passes while an accidental one still fails.

/// also names no `StateRef` — an exclusion added for
/// `attn::dequant_kv_cache_layer_to_bf16_active`, which stages a cache,

/// in `opt_writes` against a statement declaring no out". So the row
/// asks for the output, the lowerer declines to pass it, and the `Val`
/// the guard hands qwen3.5's attention is written by nobody.
///
/// Which makes the fix a row question rather than an `OpKind` question:
