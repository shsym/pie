//! `qwen3_5`'s SHAPE: the numbers a checkpoint of the GDN hybrid has.
//!
//! Ungated, because a row is written in these words and a row is the
//! crate's identity under every aspect -- `chat` asks which template
//! speaks for it, `contract` asks how to author it, `forward` asks what
//! to trace. `llama_like`'s `spec.rs` made the argument first; this
//! family follows it, and has one more reason to: the hybrid's layer
//! SCHEDULE (which layers are gated-delta-net and which are full
//! attention) is what its manifest and its `Deployment` are both
//! projections of, and neither of those belongs to the tracer.
//!
//! What stayed behind in `forward/facts.rs` is [`Qwen35CudaFacts`], the
//! per-backend BINDING facts -- env gates, workspace ceilings, which
//! joins the load materialized. Those name kernels, so they belong to
//! the aspect that has them.
