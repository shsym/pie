//! Three functions, and each one used to be a paragraph of
//! `deployment_cuda`. `qwen35_facts_from_hf` read a parsed `config.json`
//! for the twenty numbers below; the vtable's `gdn_shape()` re-derived
//! the recurrent geometry from those facts a second time, at fire time,
//! through a trait whose other twelve methods were defaults. The numbers
//! were always the ROW's — a checkpoint of Qwen3.5-4B has 32 layers
//! whether or not anyone parsed a document to find out — so they are
//! stated once and projected here.
//!
//! Written against [`Qwen35HybridFacts`] rather than against a row type,
//! for `llama_like::project`'s reason: the dense hybrid and the MoE
//! hybrid are the same shape with a different block between the norms,
//! and a projection that took the row would have to be written twice.
