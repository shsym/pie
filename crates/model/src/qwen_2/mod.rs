//! Qwen 2 — the 2.5 release.
//!
//! One generation, one directory: the rows below and the ChatML
//! constructor in [`chat`]. The authoring pass is the lineage's, next
//! door in `crate::shared::llama_like::contract`, which is what "one family, many
//! rows" means in this crate — a generation adds the two answers a shape
//! cannot give, and borrows the rest.
//!
//! # The attention bias is the generation's signature
//!
//! Qwen2 is the llama block plus `{q,k,v}_proj.bias`, and that one bit
//! travelled badly. It arrived as `attention_bias` out of a
//! `config.json` and was believed; a checkpoint whose converter dropped
//! the key deployed as an unbiased model that loaded, ran, and answered
//! subtly wrongly. Here it is a manifest ROW — `layer.{}.q_proj.bias`,
//! required, `[q_heads * head_dim]` — so a checkpoint without it is not
//! this variant rather than being this variant deployed wrong.
//!
//! # The window that was read but never switched on
//!
//! Every Qwen2.5 config carries `sliding_window` (32768 or 131072) AND
//! `use_sliding_window: false`. The old derivation passed the width
//! through because it read the key; the switch beside it decided
//! nothing. These rows state `window: -1`, full attention, which is what
//! the checkpoints actually do — and what the committed
//! [`LlamaLikeFacts::qwen2_5_1_5b`] fixture already says by calling the
//! window "unused".
