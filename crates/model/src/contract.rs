//! The contract aspect: a row in, an authored contract out.
//!
//! This module used to BE the registry — two `const` tables keyed on the
//! `model_type` string out of a `config.json`, 52 rows between them, and
//! a `find` over whichever the driver's [`Naming`] selected. It is now a
//! single function, because the registry moved to
//! [`catalog`](crate::catalog) and there is only one of it.
//!
//! That is the whole change, and it is worth being precise about what it
//! bought. `tests/registry_agreement.rs` existed to hold THREE tables to
//! each other — this one, the CUDA arch table, and Metal's
//! `model_family_of` — because a `model_type` added to one and not the
//! others surfaced as two unrelated errors ("unsupported model_type"
//! from a driver, "no author" from here) whose common cause nothing
//! named. A test that checks two tables agree is a test that exists
//! because there are two tables. There is one now, every driver links
//! it, and the disagreement it was watching for cannot be expressed.
//!
//! What is left here is a pure function from
//! `(row, encoding, checkpoint, target, policy)` to the contract the
//! loader compiles. Nothing here opens a file or asks a device — both of
//! those are the caller's, which is what lets one row serve a driver
//! boot, an offline `pie model build`, and a test that authors against a
//! fixture.

/// whichever the [`Naming`] selected, plus an `Ok(None)` for "no row
/// claims this string".
///
/// All three are gone, and each for its own reason:
///
/// - The **tables** are gone because a row states its own author. That
///   is the same N:1 the table column expressed — a dozen generations
///   calling `author_llama_like` — spelled as a call, where nothing can
///   drift out of step with the other two answers the same row gives.
/// - The **string key** is gone because identity is not a string any
///   more. `"qwen3"` reached one author and `"qwen3_moe"` reached
///   another, and the second disagreed with what the same string
///   selected in `FACTS_ROWS`.
/// - The **`Option`** is gone because the caller cannot get here without
///   a row. [`identify`](crate::catalog::identify) either matched a
///   checkpoint to a variant or refused; "authored nothing, returned
///   `Ok`" was a third outcome that every caller had to remember to
///   check, and one of them turned it into `UnknownFamily` several
///   frames later, having lost the reason.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// The row's author refused: the checkpoint contradicts a shape it
/// asserts, or the contract came out empty.
