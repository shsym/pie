//! The three projections a gemma-3 row makes.
//!
//! Gemma 3 IS a `llama_like` configuration — same attention, same
//! block, and the family's own tracer serves it — so this module is a
//! wrapper and not a fourth family. What it adds is the two things
//! `LlamaLikeFacts` deliberately does not hold, both of them per LAYER:
//!
//! * **Two rope bases.** Gemma 3 rotates its five sliding layers at
//!   10 000 and its sixth, full-attention layer at 1 000 000. The shape
//!   holds one `RopeKind` and no theta at all — theta reaches the driver
//!   through `Deployment`, per layer — so the two bases are ROW fields
//!   and this module builds the schedule.
//! * **The 5:1 window.** `deployment_cuda` reached gemma-3 through
//!   `llama_like_facts_from_hf`, whose `window_by_layer` is empty, so
//!   `deployment_of` broadcast the config's single `sliding_window` to
//!   all sixty-two layers. Every sixth layer then attended 1024 tokens
//!   instead of the whole context — silently, because a window that is
//!   too small produces fluent text about the wrong prefix.
//!
//! The same derivation also read `norm_variant: Plain` and
//! `norm_placement: Pre` for gemma-3, because the generic reader had no
//! way to ask and the row it landed in had no way to say. Both are
//! stated on the rows now, which is the difference the catalog makes:
//! the numbers are not derived from a config, they ARE the model.

// Only the texts name a backend, and only they are gated.
