//! Gemma 3 — a llama-like shape on a schedule of its own.
//!
//! Five rows, one shape struct shared with a dozen other generations,
//! and a small projection wrapper for the two things that shape cannot
//! hold: a rope base that differs per layer and a window that is not the
//! same on every layer. See [`project`] for why both are row fields.
//!
//! What used to be here was `("gemma3", llama_like_facts_from_hf)` in
//! `deployment_cuda::FACTS_ROWS` — the GENERIC llama-like derivation,
//! which read gemma-3's norms as Plain/Pre, broadcast the config's
//! single `sliding_window` to every layer and its single `rope_theta`
//! along with it. None of that failed loudly. A model whose every sixth
//! layer attends 1024 tokens instead of its whole context still writes
//! fluent sentences.
