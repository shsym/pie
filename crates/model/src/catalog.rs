//! **The** table: one row per model, and every aspect answered on it.
//!
//! # The three keys that were one key
//!
//! This crate used to dispatch on three strings that all came out of
//! `config.json`, through three tables that nothing held together:
//!
//! | key | table | answers |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `model_type` | `contract::HF_ROWS` | who authors the load |
//! | `model_type` | `deployment_cuda::FACTS_ROWS` | what to deploy |
//! | `arch_name` | `instruct::create` | how to format a chat |
//!
//! Three tables existed because the identity arrived **at run time**, as
//! text, and each aspect had to re-key on it. Nothing made the answers
//! agree, and they did not: `qwen3_moe` authored as a GDN mixture and
//! deployed as a dense stack, for as long as anyone had been looking.
//!
//! Move the identity to compile time and the three answers land in one
//! ROW, where there is no seam for them to disagree across. That is the
//! whole of this module.
//!
//! # A row is reached by matching, not by parsing
//!
//! What replaces the string is [`crate::manifest`]: a row states the
//! tensors its own numbers imply, and a checkpoint is the row whose
//! manifest it satisfies. The reason is not ergonomics — it is that
//! **identification and validation become one operation**. A
//! `config.json` that lies is believed by a derivation and contradicted
//! by an assertion much later, or never; a checkpoint either publishes
//! `layer.{}.q_proj` at `[2048, 1024]` or it does not, and a variant
//! whose numbers say otherwise simply is not the one in front of you.
//!
//! It also settles what the old code did by sniffing. Four probes inside
//! one derivation asked whether the embedding table exists, whether the
//! norm is pre or post, whether the q-norm is per-head or global, and
//! whether the projections came fused. All four are manifest rows now,
//! and a checkpoint that answers them differently matches a different
//! variant rather than taking a different branch inside one.
//!
//! # No default method bodies
//!
//! Deliberate, and the reason is [`crate::deployment`]'s: the trait this
//! replaces had thirteen methods, twelve of them with default bodies,
//! and the defaults were where the exceptions hid.
//! `pins_attention_values()` returned `true` with the doc *"Only gemma-4
//! does"*; `sm_scale()` divided by `sqrt(head_dim)` because every family
//! but one does. A default body is a claim about every row that has not
//! been written yet, which is the one claim nobody is in a position to
//! make.
//!
//! So every row answers every question. The fixtures already work this
//! way — *"stated rather than defaulted because a fixture is a
//! measurement of a real checkpoint"* — and this makes the discipline
//! the type system's.
//!
//! # What a row is NOT keyed by
//!
//! **Quantization.** Qwen3-8B ships bf16, FP8, AWQ-int4 and MLX-int4;
//! splitting the row four ways would quadruple the table to record
//! something that is not about the model. A row is the LOGICAL model,
//! its manifest compares logical extents, and the observed encoding
//! flows on into [`crate::shared::policy`] — which is where a decision about how
//! to read weights belongs.
//!
//! **Packaging.** Which safetensors shard a tensor landed in gets
//! revised without the model changing, so a manifest names logical
//! tensors and never a file.
//!
//! # The cost, stated honestly
//!
//! A closed set closes new SIZES of known models, not just new models: a
//! Qwen3-72B needs a release. [`Override`] is the escape hatch, and it
//! is deliberately not a way to get a wrong answer quietly — an override
//! names a row, and the named row's manifest is still checked.
