//! CSM's turn protocol.
//!
//! Not ChatML, and not anything else in this crate. CSM's template
//! validates that a message's role is a **stringified integer** — a
//! SPEAKER ID — and raises if it is not:
//!
//! ```text
//! {%- if not message['role'] is string or not message['role'].isdigit() %}
//!     {{- raise_exception("The role must be an integer ...") }}
//! ```
//!
//! and then writes each turn as
//!
//! ```text
//! <|begin_of_text|>[{speaker}]{text}<|end_of_text|>
//! ```
//!
//! with `<|AUDIO|><|audio_eos|>` appended when the turn carries audio.
//! There is no `system` role, no assistant marker, and no generation
//! prompt in the HuggingFace sense — a turn is opened by naming a
//! speaker.
//!
//! # Why this file exists at all
//!
//! [`crate::catalog::Variant::chat`] has no default body, so a row must
//! answer it, and CSM is the row that proves why that is the right
//! design. Under the registry this replaced, `architectures[0]` was
//! `CsmForConditionalGeneration`, no arm matched it, and the `_ =>` arm
//! handed back ChatML — so a CSM would have been prompted with
//! `<|im_start|>user`, tokens its vocabulary does not contain, and
//! stopped on an `<|im_end|>` it can never emit. A conversation that
//! never ends is what a wrong template looks like from outside.
//!
//! The mapping from pie's two conversational roles to CSM's speaker ids
//! is this file's one editorial decision: **user is speaker 0 and
//! assistant is speaker 1**, which is the convention the reference
//! implementation's own examples use. It is stated here, once, rather
//! than assumed at three call sites.
