//! What a CSM checkpoint IS.
//!
//! CSM is three stacks in one package, and that is the whole reason
//! this generation is written differently from every other one in the
//! catalog:
//!
//! * a **backbone**, an ordinary llama-like decoder that reads
//!   interleaved text and audio-code frames;
//! * a **depth decoder**, a second, narrower decoder that runs once per
//!   frame and emits the 32 residual codebooks in order;
//! * a **Mimi codec**, a convolutional encoder/decoder with a
//!   transformer in the middle and a residual vector quantizer, which
//!   turns waveforms into those codes and back.
//!
//! Nothing else in the catalog has more than one stack. `Deployment`
//! describes ONE — one layer count, one geometry, one KV store — so the
//! numbers below are stated in full here and [`super::project`] refuses
//! rather than picking the backbone's and calling it the model's. The
//! refusal is the point: it says what is missing by name instead of
//! answering with a stack that would load, page and fire, and produce
//! text where audio was asked for.
//!
//! Every number below is a measurement of `sesame/csm-1b` — its
//! `config.json` and its `model.safetensors` header, which is 537
//! tensors and agrees with the config field for field.

/// The backbone: the decoder that reads the interleaved frame stream.
///
/// It is llama-like — GQA, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, llama3 rope scaling — and
/// that resemblance is a trap this row exists to spring. A llama-like
/// derivation reading this config finds every key it wants and produces
/// a servable 16-layer stack; what it cannot find is the depth decoder
/// that turns the backbone's one hidden row into 32 codes, so the
/// "working" model emits a first codebook and nothing that plays.
