//! The CSM lineage: speech — a backbone, a depth decoder, and a Mimi
//! codec.
//!
//! The generation that answers a question with a REFUSAL, and the
//! reason [`Variant::deployment`] and [`Variant::trace`] return a
//! `Result` at all.
//!
//! CSM loads. Its contract is written, it binds every tensor in the
//! package, and [`contract::author_csm`] narrows the fp32 checkpoint to
//! the bf16 its kernels read. What it does not have is forward text:
//! there is no `csm/forward` module in this crate and there never has
//! been. Under the design this replaces, that fact had nowhere to be
//! said. A family with no forward answered `None` from a defaulted
//! trait method, which every caller read as "nothing unusual"; a family
//! with no deployment derivation fell off the end of `FACTS_ROWS`, and
//! for CSM the llama-like fallback would have SUCCEEDED, because its
//! backbone states every key a llama reader wants under exactly the
//! spelling it wants them. The result is a stack that pages, fires, and
//! returns audio codebook indices to a caller that asked for speech.
//!
//! So the row below states what it is and refuses what it cannot do,
//! by name. The refusals live in [`project`] as `const` strings so the
//! tests can hold them to naming the missing thing rather than to being
//! non-empty.
//!
//! Chat is NOT refused, because it is not missing: CSM's turn protocol
//! is published and short, and [`chat`] implements it. A `chat()` that
//! cannot refuse — the trait's signature returns an `Arc`, not a
//! `Result` — is exactly why: a template is always answerable, and the
//! previous answer for this generation was Qwen's ChatML by fallthrough.
