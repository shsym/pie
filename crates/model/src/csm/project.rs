//! The three projections a CSM row makes — and two of them are
//! refusals.
//!
//! This is the generation the `Result` on
//! [`Variant::deployment`](crate::catalog::Variant::deployment) and
//! [`Variant::trace`](crate::catalog::Variant::trace) was added for.
//! CSM has a contract — [`super::contract::author_csm`] binds every
//! tensor in the package and narrows the fp32 checkpoint to bf16 — and
//! it has no traced forward text at all. There is no `forward/` module
//! in this generation, and there never has been.
//!
//! # Why a refusal, and not a `None`
//!
//! The trait this replaces answered these questions with defaults. A
//! family that had no forward returned `None` from a defaulted method
//! and the caller read that as "nothing special here"; a family with no
//! deployment facts fell through `FACTS_ROWS` to a llama-like
//! derivation, which for CSM would have SUCCEEDED — the backbone states
//! `hidden_size`, `num_attention_heads`, `num_key_value_heads`,
//! `head_dim`, `intermediate_size` and `rms_norm_eps` under exactly the
//! spellings a llama reader wants. It would have produced a servable
//! 16-layer stack over a 2051-entry vocabulary, paged it, fired it, and
//! returned audio codebook indices to a caller that asked for speech.
//!
//! So the refusals below name what is MISSING. A `Refusal::Unsupported`
//! is a statement about this BUILD — the checkpoint is fine, and a pie
//! with a CSM decoder in it would serve the same row — which is why it
//! is not `Malformed`, and why the row still answers
//! [`manifest`] and `load_shape` in full.
