//! The load path every driver walks: descriptor in, plan out.
//!
//! A driver boots a checkpoint by authoring a load contract and compiling it
//! into a [`LoadPlan`]. Both halves of that live here already —
//! [`contract::author_with_policy`] is this crate's, `plan::compile` is
//! `model-loader`'s — and what a driver adds is the [`Policy`]: which
//! projection layout its GEMMs take, which tensor names its bind path reads.
//!
//! Those two answers are the whole of the difference. `driver-metal` and
//! `driver-cuda` each carried a `compile_load_plan` that differed in exactly
//! [`Policy::projections`] and [`Policy::naming`]; every other field, the
//! author call, the compile call, and the file check were identical, and each
//! file's own comment said so ("carried the same block, bit for bit"). Two
//! copies of a policy is not a spelling problem: a field added to [`Policy`]
//! gets a considered value on the copy its author was looking at and a
//! `Default` on the other, so **equal requests stop authoring equal
//! contracts** — silently, because both still compile and both still boot.
//!
//! So the policy is stated once, here, and a driver names only what it knows
//! that this module cannot: its [`Binding`].
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It does not read the snapshot directory to find out what is in it. The
//! caller passes a parsed [`CheckpointMetadata`], because *which* files a
//! checkpoint has is a fact a driver may already have needed for its own
//! reasons — `driver-cuda` parses it before boot and uses it twice — and a
//! second parse inside here would be this module deciding to do I/O the
//! caller had already done.
//!
//! It does stat the files the finished plan declares, which is I/O of a
//! different kind: not "what is here" but "is what I just promised still
//! true". That check has to happen after the plan exists, so no caller can
//! do it instead.

///   stored says so through [`StorageTarget::native_mxfp4_moe`] and one that
///   does not gets them transcoded. The device already answers this; asking
///   the operator again would let the two disagree.
/// - [`Component::Full`], because a driver boots a whole model. A component
///   split is a serving decision, and no driver takes it at load.
/// - `stream_routed_experts: false` and [`FamilyKnobs::default`], because
///   these are operator knobs no driver has a surface for. Stated as zeros
