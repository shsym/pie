//! The Nemotron-H lineage: the MAMBA2 hybrid — selective-scan layers
//! interleaved with attention layers and with layers that are nothing
//! but an MLP.
//!
//! Three layer kinds, and a SCHEDULE rather than an interval. That is
//! the fact this generation contributes to the catalog: qwen3.5 and
//! kimi_k3 alternate on a period and can state their schedule as one
//! number, while NVIDIA's 47B carries `M---MM---M` in its tail — three
//! mixerless layers, then two scans back to back. [`spec`] holds the
//! transcription and the test that holds it to the published string.
//!
//! # What the row closed
//!
//! The deleted `nemotron_h_facts_from_hf` read the MLP width from
//! `moe_intermediate_size`, a key no published Nemotron-H states, so
//! every real checkpoint would have been traced with a dense MLP of
//! width ZERO and a router over no experts. It never fired that way
//! because the only stack this family was ever run on is the six-layer
//! synthetic fixture — which IS a mixture, and so took the one path that
//! worked. The rows below state the dense width the checkpoints ship,
//! and [`forward`] stops before the routed block when a stack has no
//! experts.
//!
//! Chat: ChatML that opens the assistant turn already inside a
//! `<think>`, which `instruct::create` reached through a registry row
//! pointing at qwen3's implementation. Stated per row here.
