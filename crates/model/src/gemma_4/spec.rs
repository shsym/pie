//! Gemma-4's semantic shape: the numbers a row IS.
//!
//! Ungated, and that is the whole reason this file exists apart from
//! `forward/facts.rs`. A row has to answer `manifest()`, `load_shape()`
//! and `deployment()` in a build with no `forward` feature at all — the
//! contract-only builds do exactly that — so the struct those three
//! answers are projected from cannot live behind `#[cfg(feature =
//! "forward")]`. What stays next door is the BACKEND's facts
//! ([`super::forward::facts::Gemma4CudaFacts`]): what the loader
//! materialised, built at trace time, per-layer `Vec`s and all.
//!
//! The dividing line is not "semantic vs backend" as a taste; it is
//! `const`. A row is a `const` item in `.rodata`, so a shape a row holds
//! may not own a heap allocation, and the two questions "how wide is
//! this model" and "did this load fuse its QKV" fall on opposite sides
//! of that line by themselves.

/// Facts for the GEMMA-4 family — the third declared family, and the
/// first whose per-layer axis carries TWO HEAD DIMS.
///
/// # What makes this family its own declaration
///
/// gemma-4 alternates sliding and full attention on a regular interval,
/// like qwen3_5's hybrid — but where qwen3_5's two layer kinds are two
/// different ATTENTIONS, gemma-4's are the same attention at different
/// geometry: `head_dim` 256 on a sliding layer, `global_head_dim` 512 on
/// a full one, with partial rope on the full layers only. The window
/// itself is not trace vocabulary at all: it is a scalar `window_left`
/// the driver reads per layer from the deployment, which is why nothing
/// here names it.
///
/// Two things ARE structural and have no analogue in the families
/// declared so far:
///
/// * **KV sharing.** The last [`Self::kv_shared_layers`] layers project
///   no k/v, norm no k/v, rope no k, and write no cache — they attend
///   through the pages of the last earlier layer of the SAME kind. The
///   elision is per layer and total, so it is a fact the trace reads to
///   decide which statements exist, not a runtime branch.
/// * **PLE** (per-layer embeddings). A prologue that embeds a SECOND
///   table, projects it to `layers * ple_dim`, norms and scales it, and
///   transposes so each layer reads a contiguous slice; then a per-layer
///   epilogue gates that slice into the residual stream. It is the
///   reason gemma-4 cannot be a `llama_like` configuration.
///
/// (There is no altup here. That is gemma3n's mechanism —
/// `crates/driver-cuda/csrc/src/model/gemma4/` never mentions it.)
