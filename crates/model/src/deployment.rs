//! `Deployment` — everything a driver needs to serve a checkpoint, with
//! no family name in it.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not a trait
//!
//! The drivers used to ask a `Box<dyn PlannedFamily>` thirteen
//! questions, and its own doc comments named the exception in the
//! method: `pins_attention_values()` said *"Only gemma-4 does"*, and
//! `decode_plan_head_dims()` existed because gemma-4's two layer kinds
//! disagree. Then the callers undid the abstraction to get the name
//! back — `let is_gemma4 = family.planless_prefill();` appears twice in
//! the CUDA shell and once in its transfer path.
//!
//! Wrapping a family name in a virtual predicate and then recovering the
//! name at the call site means **the axis was the family all along**.
//!
//! It also cost at run time. `facts_from_hf` was called from the
//! admission of EVERY fire, allocating a box and cloning per-layer
//! `Vec`s — while the lowering it feeds is cached precisely because it
//! costs 3.3 ms. The expensive answer was cached; its input was
//! rederived.
//!
//! # What changes about gemma-4
//!
//! Its two head dims stop being an exception and become
//! `attention[l].head_dim` differing between layers, which is what they
//! are. A `Vec` of per-layer facts has no opinion about which family
//! produced it.
//!
//! # Why it lives HERE
//!
//! `crates/model/tests/one_normalizer.rs` states the rule: *"what a
//! driver reads is the answer, never the question."* The drivers obeyed
//! the letter — they read `pie.model/1`, not `config.json` — while the
//! answer was still SHAPED like the question and they still switched on
//! it: 33 `FACTS_ROWS` rows and 11 derivations in the CUDA shell alone,
//! against the 25 `model_type` conditionals of the C++ normalizer that
//! test was written to hunt.
//!
//! A `Deployment` with no family name in it is a type a driver
//! **cannot** branch on. That is the difference between a guard that
//! must be remembered and one that cannot be routed around.
