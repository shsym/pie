/// says what runs.

/// plausibility for correctness:
///
/// * the M>1 (Prefill) lane states one GEMM and one paged attention, and
///   that was written down as a guess against `MultiBatchPsos`'s split-k,
///   fp16-precast, strided and bias variants. Checked 2026-08-10: it is
///   **correct for what runs**. The live `MbFeatures` on this family is
///   `{ gdn, sdpa_d256 }` — every one of those variants is `false` in every
///   live path and set true only in `psos_mb.rs`'s `all_features()` test
///   fixture, and `PARITY-BATCH.md` records them as deferred with reasons
///   ("with split-K deferred every dispatch is unsplit, which by the C++'s
///   OWN measurement makes `qmm_bn_unsplit` the right width"). `bias` is
///   gpt-oss's, and `routed` is a mixture this family does not model at all.
///   So the driver carries rungs nothing turns on; the text states the lane
///   that fires. What remains untested is the `kQmmMinBatch` gate, which the
///   text takes as the load-time fact `qmm_multi_batch` rather than deciding.
/// * ~~`sdpa_*_d_256` pins head_dim 256~~ — **fixed 2026-08-10, and it was a
///   real defect rather than a simplification.** `dsl::metal::sdpa` spelled
///   the width as a literal, so this family — whose heads are 128 wide —
///   named a 256-wide attention kernel. That does not fault: it reads past
///   the end of every head and answers with whatever is there, which is the
///   same defect `PARITY-BATCH.md` records in the C++ llama walk, where
///   `_d128` was a literal that strode 64-wide heads past their end. The
///   symbol now takes `head_dim`; a width no kernel instantiates simply does
///   not resolve, and the driver's row check reports it by name.
/// * no seams. The adapter, the two observation taps and the boundaries
///   are stated by the CUDA text and absent here, because none of the
///   machinery behind them exists on this backend yet.
/// * qk-norm and bias are stated as ordinary norms and are untested
