//! What a model IS: the two registries that turn a model's name into an
//! implementation, and the implementations they dispatch to.
//!
//! ## Three aspects, one crate
//!
//! * [`contract`] — `model_type` to the author that writes its load contract.
//! * [`instruct`] — `arch_name` to the chat template that formats for it.
//! * `<generation>::forward` — the forward pass, written in
//!   `model-compiler`'s tracing eDSL, and [`ffi`] the door a driver reaches it
//!   through. Behind the non-default `forward` feature, because `pie model
//!   convert` wants the first two and not a tracer.
//!
//! The first two are REGISTRIES and the third is not: a forward pass is
//! reached by the driver naming a family over the C ABI, not by a row. That
//! asymmetry is real and is why `forward` sits on the generation module
//! rather than in a table beside the other two.
//!
//! They deliberately partition the model space differently: templates split by
//! release, contracts by storage schema. So a generation is reached through a
//! *row*, never as a module path, and every N:1 reuse is written out — a dozen
//! `model_type`s share Llama 3's dense author, and ChatML serves four vendors.
//!
//! A generation with no implementation of its own gets no module: `mixtral`,
//! `deepseek_v2`, `deepseek_v3`, `ministral3`, `gemma3n`, `kimi_k25` and
//! `qwen3_6` are rows naming the generation whose implementation they share.
//!
//! ## Why one crate, when a generation used to be one
//!
//! Twenty generation crates, a `common`, and this registry were twenty-two
//! packages. The crate boundary was there to stop one generation reaching into
//! another — and it had already stopped doing that: `qwen_2` depended on
//! `qwen_3` for ChatML, because the thing they share is real. What the boundary
//! still cost was `common`, a crate that existed only because siblings needed
//! somewhere to share from, and a feature matrix that named every generation
//! twice.
//!
//! So the isolation moves from the crate system to a `#[test]`
//! (`tests/sibling_isolation.rs`), stated as one rule:
//!
//! > **A generation module may name [`families`] and the shared root. It may
//! > not name a sibling.**
//!
//! And the sharing that broke the old rule gets the home the rule implies:
//! ChatML — which `qwen3`, `qwen3_5`, `nemotron_h`, `glm_moe_dsa` and `qwen2`
//! all bind — is [`families::chatml`], not a file inside whichever generation
//! happened to write it down first.
//!
//! The module layout mirrors the old crate layout on purpose. A generation
//! that grows big enough to want its own crate again can be lifted back out
//! mechanically.
//!
//! ## The shared root
//!
//! Everything a generation may reach: the authoring DSL ([`builder`]), the
//! vocabulary it is parameterized by ([`facts`], [`policy`]), the shared shapes
//! ([`probe`], [`moe`], [`mlx`]), and the chat trait and [`decoders`] behind
//! it. The test for whether something belongs here is unchanged and still
//! enforced (`tests/common_is_thin.rs`): it must be *about models in general*,
//! never a fact about one generation's checkpoints or templates.
//!
//! **Thin means no knowledge, not few lines.** [`builder`] is the largest file
//! here and that is correct — it is the authoring DSL, and every generation
//! calls its passes directly. Bulk is only a smell when it is knowledge.
//!
//! [`multimodal`] is the exception: host-side image and audio decode is a
//! third aspect and it is family-aware (it dispatches on a `VisionArch`), so
//! it is neither shared vocabulary nor one generation's fact. It sits at the
//! root until it is split per generation the way chat and contract are.
//!
//! The model *service* — the global model/tokenizer cache — is not here. It
//! was runtime machinery rather than family knowledge and lives in
//! `engine/src/model.rs`; only [`ModelMetadata`] stayed, because the worker
//! reads it without linking the runtime.
