//! What a checkpoint's FILES say about how its numbers are stored.
//!
//! The third decision of the catalog design, and the one that keeps the
//! table small enough to be a table: **quantization is policy, not
//! identity**. Qwen3-8B ships as bf16, as FP8, as AWQ-int4 and as
//! MLX-int4. Four rows for one model would quadruple the catalog and
//! would be four statements of one geometry, which is the exact failure
//! the catalog exists to end.
//!
//! So a row is the LOGICAL model — the shapes — and the manifest
//! matches modulo encoding, undoing the packing on the last axis before
//! it compares. What is observed instead lands here and flows to the
//! authoring pass as a [`Policy`](crate::shared::policy::Policy) input, which is
//! where it always belonged: `push_mlx_affine_declared` needs to know a
//! width, and a width is a property of a file.
//!
//! These three fields are the ones `ModelFacts` carried that were never
//! shape. Everything else that struct held is either the dispatch key
//! (gone — the row IS the dispatch) or is
//! [`LoadShape`](crate::catalog::LoadShape).
