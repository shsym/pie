//! The ingest aspect: a foreign vocabulary in, this crate's own out.
//!
//! [`contract`](crate::contract) is this module's mirror. It answers "how
//! does a row's checkpoint become tensors a device binds" -- zt to GPU. This
//! one answers the question one layer below: how does a checkpoint written in
//! somebody else's vocabulary become a zt artifact at all.
//!
//! For HuggingFace the answer is "it already is one", which is why this
//! module names only GGUF. That identity is an accident worth stating: the
//! catalog's rows are spelled HuggingFace-shaped, so a HuggingFace checkpoint
//! passes through and matches. `tests/a_row_identifies_from_its_own_names.rs`
//! turns the accident into a decision, and this module is what a vocabulary
//! that does NOT get the accident has to go through.
//!
//! # Dispatched on what the file says, not on what it looks like
//!
//! `crate::shared::weight_names::wire` has to sniff: it picks a family by
//! looking for a tensor only one of them publishes, in an order that matters,
//! with qwen3.5 explicitly bailing when gemma-4's tensor is present. Nothing
//! here needs that, because a GGUF declares `general.architecture` in its
//! key-value block. The dispatch is a string match on a fact the file states
//! about itself.
//!
//! # Five arms, and the others refusing
//!
//! `qwen2`, `qwen3`, `qwen3moe`, `llama` and `gemma3` are here. That the rest
//! are missing is not a stub: they are REFUSED, by name, with the reason --
//! which is the same shape the family contract table already uses ("no MLX
//! authoring pass exists..."), and it is an honest answer where a silent
//! partial map would not be. Adding an architecture is a module in its
//! generation and an arm here.
//!
//! # Why an arm answers five questions and not one
//!
//! A rename was enough for `qwen2` and `qwen3`, and both were CHECKED to be:
//! a BF16 GGUF and the safetensors release it came from agree bit for bit.
//! The others prove a rename is not the general case, and they fail
//! differently. `llama` reorders the rows of Q and K and publishes a
//! `rope_freqs.weight` that is not a weight. `gemma3` publishes every norm as
//! `w + 1`, because llama.cpp folds the constant its kernel would otherwise
//! add and pie's kernel adds its own. `qwen3moe` publishes its experts
//! JOINED: one `[E, I, H]` tensor where the safetensors release has `E`
//! separate ones.
//!
//! So a pass states a name, which tensors the converter DERIVED, which rows
//! regroup, which constants were folded, and which tensors are a stack of
//! many -- all five together, because a family that answered one and was
//! forgotten by another is a model that loads, serves, and answers slightly
//! wrong. Every one of these failures is invisible to a shape check, which is
//! the only check that runs.
//!
//! # An architecture that is refused for a measured reason: `gpt-oss`
//!
//! Not every GGUF can be ingested, and the one that cannot is worth naming
//! here because it looks like it can. gpt-oss's GGUF is a mixture like
//! `qwen3moe`, and the arm it would need is not the same arm.
//!
//! Measured on `ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF`, against the artifact the
//! published safetensors import to:
//!
//! * The experts are MXFP4, and llama.cpp's MXFP4 block is **self-contained**
//!   -- 17 bytes holding one E8M0 scale byte and 16 bytes of codes. The
//!   safetensors release splits the same numbers into a `_blocks` tensor of
//!   16-byte rows and a `_scales` tensor of single bytes, which is the pair
//!   the contract in `crate::gpt_oss` declares. Getting from one to the other
//!   means addressing INSIDE a block, and the placement algebra refuses that
//!   by construction: see `ByteScale::Blocked` in
//!   `model_loader::contract::compile`, where only whole blocks have
//!   addresses because half a block is codes with no scale to read them by.
//!   It is not a budget problem -- though it is also that, at 16.6 M runs per
//!   tensor against a `MAX_RUNS` of 1 M.
//! * GGUF keeps `ffn_gate_exps` and `ffn_up_exps` apart where the checkpoint
//!   fuses them into one `gate_up_proj` with gate on even rows and up on odd.
//!   Interleaving is expressible; splitting the block is not, so this one
//!   never gets its turn.
//! * That file also requantizes attention and the embeddings to Q8_0, so it
//!   is not a lossless carrier of the checkpoint pie can already import.
//!
//! Which is why there is no `gpt-oss` arm: it would need a fifth `Ingest`
//! shape whose transform the loader cannot perform. `qwen3moe` needed one
//! too, and got it, because a slab of a BF16 stack is a contiguous run.
//!
//! # An architecture refused for the opposite reason: `gemma4`
//!
//! `gpt-oss` is refused because its weights cannot be reached. `gemma4` is
//! refused although its weights are the EASIEST of any file measured here --
//! which is why the reason has to be written down, or the next reader will
//! see how short the map is and write it.
//!
//! Measured on `unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF` BF16, range-read against
//! `unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it` at the same tensors:
//!
//! * The text tower is a **pure rename**. `attn_q`, `ffn_gate_up_exps` and
//!   `ffn_down_exps` are byte-identical to `self_attn.q_proj.weight`,
//!   `experts.gate_up_proj` and `experts.down_proj`. The mixture arrives
//!   already fused as `[E, 2I, H]` in the checkpoint's own order, so this
//!   family does not even need [`Ingest::Unstack`] that `qwen3moe` did.
//! * **Nothing is folded into the norms.** `attn_norm`, `ffn_norm`,
//!   `post_ffw_norm_2` and `output_norm` all differ from their HuggingFace
//!   counterparts by exactly `0.0`, where `gemma3` differs by exactly `1.0`.
//!   Both files widen to F32 what the checkpoint holds as BF16 and change no
//!   value. This agrees with the forward pass -- gemma-4 norms are
//!   `NormVariant::Plain` where gemma-3's are `NormVariant::Gemma` -- so
//!   there is no constant for a converter to fold. Copying `gemma3`'s
//!   [`crate::gemma_3::import::folded_constant`] into a gemma-4 arm on the
//!   strength of the shared family name would be wrong by one everywhere,
//!   which is the exact failure that function's own documentation exists to
//!   prevent, running backwards.
//!
//! What refuses it is the tower. Every gemma-4 row this build ships states
//! `vision: Some(..)`, and the E-series states an audio tower besides;
//! llama.cpp puts neither in the model file. They live in a SEPARATE
//! `mmproj-*.gguf` whose `general.architecture` is `clip` and whose
//! `general.type` is `mmproj` -- 1411 tensors for `gemma-4-E2B`, under an `a.`
//! and `v.` naming scheme this module has never seen, carrying per-tensor
//! `input_max`/`output_min` calibration scalars that no HuggingFace
//! checkpoint has a name for at all.
//!
//! So an arm here would import cleanly and produce an artifact that matches
//! no row, every time, because the half of the model the row asks for is in a
//! file this pass was not given. Refusing at the door says that once. The
//! text map above is the head start for whoever brings the tower.
