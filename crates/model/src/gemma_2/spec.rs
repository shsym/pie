//! Gemma 2's SHAPE: the numbers a gemma-2 checkpoint has.
//!
//! Ungated, for the reason `shared/llama_like/spec.rs` states: a
//! catalog row is written in these words, and a row is the crate's
//! identity under EVERY aspect — `chat` asks which template speaks for
//! it, `contract` asks who authors its load, `forward` asks what to
//! trace. One struct, three readers, which cannot hold if the struct
//! only exists when the tracer is compiled in.
//!
//! It is also what makes a row a `const`. A `const` cannot own a `Vec`,
//! and that is not a limitation to work around here — it is a question
//! worth answering, and the answer for gemma-2 is below.
