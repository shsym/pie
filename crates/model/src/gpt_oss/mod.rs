//! The GPT-OSS lineage: a mixture with MXFP4 expert triplets, an
//! alternating sliding window, and ATTENTION SINKS.
//!
//! Three facts about this generation are why its rows are worth reading
//! carefully.
//!
//! The sinks first: one learned logit per query head, appended to the
//! softmax denominator. No other row in this build ships them, and they
//! are what makes the attention statement here produce an LSE beside its
//! output. A row states them, so a deployment that has them and a text
//! that expects them come from the same place.
//!
//! Then the window: gpt-oss alternates sliding and full attention from
//! layer 0. The old path derived that list in `gpt_oss_facts_from_hf`,
//! bound it into `GptOssCudaFacts::window_left`, and then had
//! `PlannedFamily::window_by_layer()` read it BACK OUT to build the
//! deployment's table — a rule spelled once, transported through a
//! backend struct, and re-read as data. [`project::deployment`] expands
//! `is_sliding` directly, and it is the only expansion: the text states
//! no window, because every gpt-oss layer takes the sink spelling and
//! the driver reads the window per layer from the deployment.
//!
//! Then the encodings. `openai/gpt-oss-20b` publishes MXFP4 expert
//! blocks; the dequantized release publishes bf16 banks under different
//! NAMES. They are one model, so they are one row: see
//! [`project::manifest`] for how a manifest pins the mixture's geometry
//! without naming either spelling.

// `Arc` reaches this module only through `Variant::chat`, so the
// import carries that method's gate. It used to ride along with
// `OnceLock`, which `rows()` needed unconditionally until
// `rows_of!` absorbed it.
