//! that especially -- the alternating window and the attention sinks
//! are what a DEPLOYMENT states per layer, and a driver that had to
//! link the tracer to learn its window schedule would be linking a
//! tracer to serve.
//!
//! What stayed behind in `forward/facts.rs` is [`GptOssCudaFacts`], the
//! per-backend BINDING facts: which MXFP4 policy the device resolved to,
//! the fused leg's admission threshold, whether the experts are streamed.
//! Those name kernels and env, so they belong to the aspect that has them.
