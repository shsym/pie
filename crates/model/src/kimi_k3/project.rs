/// **The routed expert bank.** `contract::author_kimi_k3` reads it as

/// `.weight_scale` beside each — MXFP4, two E2M1 codes per byte, one
/// E8M0 exponent per group of 32. Every one of those extents is a
/// statement about the PACKING and not about the model: the same
/// checkpoint published bf16 would ship `[intermediate, latent]` under
/// different names, and a manifest that named either would key identity
/// on an encoding. The ROUTER is named instead, because it is the one
/// row of a mixture that is never quantized and whose extents ARE the
/// mixture: `[num_experts, hidden]`.
///
/// **`A_log` and `dt_bias`.** They are named — but their extent is the
/// checkpoint's own PADDING and not the row's arithmetic.
/// `contract::author_kimi_k3`'s band exists precisely because `A_log`
/// ships `[head_dim]` entries for `[value_heads]` real heads (F32[128]
/// where the layer has 96), so a manifest that stated `[value_heads]`
/// would fault every real checkpoint and one that stated `[head_dim]`
/// would be stating the allocator's rounding. Neither is a measurement,
/// so this states the bank's presence at the width the CONTRACT keeps —
/// see the `a_log` row below, which is `Optional` for exactly this
/// reason.
/// The width two layer kinds agree on for a name they BOTH publish, or
/// `None` where they disagree.
///
/// A hybrid's per-layer names collapse onto one key — `layer.{}.` covers
/// the whole stack — so `self_attn.o_proj` is one row standing for two
/// different projections: the MLA layers' reads the value width, the KDA
/// layers' reads the delta-net width. Where those numbers agree (they do
/// on every K3 published so far, because both are `heads * head_dim`) the
/// row is checkable and is stated. Where they disagree there is no honest
/// row to write, and stating either width would fault a checkpoint that
/// is perfectly well formed — so nothing is stated, which is a manifest
