//! DeepSeek-V4 — a rank-K residual over compressed attention and a
//! dense-prefix mixture.
//!
//! One generation, one directory, and now one ROW. What this generation
//! was before is the three-table shape the catalog exists to remove:
//! `deployment_cuda::FACTS_ROWS` held `"deepseek_v4"` against a
//! `dsv4_facts_from_hf` that re-parsed `config.json` on every load,
//! `contract::HF_ROWS` held the same string against
//! `author_deepseek_v4`, and `instruct::create` held it a third time,
//! pointing at a template that lived in a SIBLING generation's
//! directory. Three keys, three tables, and one of them reaching across
//! an edge the isolation rule forbids — the template is
//! [`crate::shared::deepseek`] now, so this row names a family and not
//! a sibling.
//!
//! The three tables also disagreed with the model. `dsv4_facts_from_hf`
//! filled `o_lora_rank: 0`, `o_groups: 1`, `hc: { mult: 1 }` and
//! `swiglu_limit_milli: 0` — a stack with an ordinary residual, an
//! ungrouped output projection and an unclamped activation, which is not
//! this generation at all. It parsed a config into a shape the config
//! does not state, and the forward text traced whatever it was handed.
//!
//! Read `VARIANTS` and then `impl Variant`. What this generation adds
//! over its shape is what a shape cannot state: which pass authors it,
//! which template speaks for it, and that no build here provisions the
//! store it needs.
