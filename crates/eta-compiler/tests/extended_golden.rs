# Source of truth: THIS COMPILER. Unlike `golden-{msl,cuda}/`, no C++ oracle
# ever produced or reviewed these bytes -- they were never cross-checked against
# a second implementation. They pin *what the emitters do today*, so that a
# change to it shows up as a diff instead of passing unnoticed.
#
# A mismatch here is a question, not a verdict: decide whether the new output is
# right, then re-pin with `PTIR_REGEN=1 cargo test -p eta-compiler`.
#
# Where a kernel is digested, `bytes` and the hash cover what the *compiler*
# generated: the hand-written device text under `crates/eta-compiler/runtime/` is
# dropped first, so tuning a kernel does not re-pin every case. That the
# emitters still splice those blocks in whole is
# `every_live_device_file_is_spliced_into_a_kernel_verbatim`.
