//===-- gaussian_topk.cuh - AltUp's activation sparsity, as a template --===//
//
// One `__global__` template and one include. The launcher that used to wrap
// it is `LaunchRule::Rms` exactly -- `<<<N, 256, (256 / 32) * sizeof(float)>>>`
// -- so it says nothing a row does not, and the row is in
// `kernels_cuda_new::families::mlp`.
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// `gaussian_topk.cu` could not be handed to NVRTC: it included
// `<cooperative_groups.h>`, and NVRTC on this machine answers 0 of 31
// standard headers with no include path. The device half moved here, the
// launcher stayed there, and §43 has since deleted that file too -- the row
// `mlp::gaussian_topk_bf16` is in `device::JIT_DISPATCHED`, so the shim held
// no entry for the launcher and nothing else called it. The ONE definition
// this arrangement was built to guarantee is still the property
// `kernels-cuda`'s `tests/sources.rs::no_global_is_defined_twice`
// exists to hold, after `norm/altup_aux` shipped two copies of a kernel for a
// release.
//
// # Cooperative groups, and why dropping them changed no bits
//
// The reduction was `cg::tiled_partition<32>(cg::this_thread_block())` and
// `tile.shfl_down`, twice: once for the row mean and once for the variance.
// The prelude's `block_sum` is that fold, line for line -- the same 16-to-1
// warp descent, the same `smem[warp]` handoff, the same second-level fold in
// warp 0, the same trailing `__syncthreads()` and the same broadcast through
// `smem[0]`. `pie_device.cuh` says so in as many words: `block_sum` is "what
// `cg::tiled_partition<32>(...).shfl_down(...)` lowered to before".
//
// That equality is the whole argument for the substitution. The fold ORDER is
// contract, not detail -- a different order sums the same values to a
// different last bit, and `driver-pipeline`'s tolerance contract holds argmax
// indices to zero -- so a reduction that merely computes the same sum would
// not have been good enough.
//
// # What the row recovers
//
// `N`. The grid was one block per row and the kernel reads `blockIdx.x`
// without a guard, so the token count was pure geometry and the rule states
// it. `dim` stayed: it is the loop bound AND the row stride, which is layout.
//
