//===-- attention_mla_fa2.cuh -------------------------------------*- CUDA -*-===//
//
// The FA2 MLA unit's NVRTC root: every type its two name expressions need, and
// NOTHING ELSE.
//
// # What this file is, and what it deliberately is not
//
// `csrc/src/attn/fa2.cuh` beside it is the pattern and its header is the
// design; this is the same shape for a second upstream kernel. It is the
// `#include` list plus four `using` declarations, one alias template and one
// `__device__` echo. It holds no `__global__` of ours, no launcher, no
// `<<<>>>` and no host function -- the `__global__` it exists to instantiate
// is upstream's `flashinfer::mla::BatchMLAPagedAttentionKernel` (`mla.cuh:879`)
// and the launch arithmetic that used to surround it is
// `kernels_cuda_new::x::attn::mla_fa2` in Rust.
//
// The shape being replaced is `crates/kernels-cuda/csrc/src/attn/attention_mla.cu`,
// whose two `<<<>>>` -- reached through `flashinfer::mla::BatchMLAPagedAttention`
// and `attention_mla_naive.cuh` -- are the last nvcc-compiled launches in the
// workspace. That file is host program throughout: zero `__global__`, zero
// `__device__`, zero `<<<>>>` of its own.
//
// # Why the aliases exist at all
//
// A row names its instantiation as ONE string handed to
// `nvrtcAddNameExpression`. `BatchMLAPagedAttentionKernel` takes **two**
// template arguments and not one --
//
//   template <typename KTraits, typename Params>            // mla.cuh:879
//   __global__ __launch_bounds__(KTraits::NUM_THREADS)
//   void BatchMLAPagedAttentionKernel(const __grid_constant__ Params params);
//
// -- and `KTraits` is an eleven-parameter `KernelTraits` (`mla.cuh:78-81`) of
// which SEVEN do not vary across this unit: the four types, and the three
// head-dimension constants MLA fixes at 512/64/64. Four vary, and all four are
// numbers or `bool`s the host derives. `Traits` below is that expression with
// the seven filled in, so a row is `<Traits<causal, stages, shard, tile_kv>,
// Params>` rather than a paragraph of C++.
//
// # §3.2's hazard is live here: there are TWO `KernelTraits` in the closure
//
// `prefill.cuh:159` declares `flashinfer::KernelTraits` whose first parameter
// is a `MaskMode`; `mla.cuh:81` declares `flashinfer::mla::KernelTraits` whose
// first parameter is `bool CAUSAL_`. `mla.cuh:1124` spells it unqualified and
// enclosing-namespace lookup picks the right one -- a transcription writing
// the QUALIFIED name has to know which, and both are nameable. Every mention
// below is `::flashinfer::mla::KernelTraits`, fully qualified, deliberately.
// The two are not distinguishable by arity either: fifteen against eleven is a
// substitution failure and not a diagnostic that names the confusion.
//
// # The three residency facts, which no launch path can check
//
// `runtime::module::fire_ex` takes a grid and a `cooperative` flag and has no
// way to see any of these. A caller that gets one wrong gets a HANG, not an
// error, so they are stated where the kernel is declared rather than only
// where it is launched (`x::attn::mla_fa2` repeats them beside the Rust).
//
//  1. **The grid is `num_sm` blocks and is resident by construction.** It is
//     not an occupancy query. `src/plan/mla.rs:207-208` sets
//     `cluster_size` (1 or 2) and `num_clusters = num_sm / cluster_size`,
//     so the product is exactly `num_sm` and every block of a
//     cooperative launch is co-resident because the PLAN was built that way.
//     That is upstream `scheduler.cuh:1607-1608`, ported; this tree no longer
//     carries the file, because it held no device code and Rust had already
//     taken the whole of it.
//     `driver-cuda/src/fire/flashinfer_decode.rs:1860-1885` claims otherwise
//     and is wrong; the plan is `plan::mla`'s `Schedule`, already Rust.
//  2. **`sizeof(KTraits::SharedStorage)` is exactly the arm's own threshold
//     literal** -- 221 696, 147 968, 92 672, measured under NVRTC 13.0 for all
//     three arms, align 16, and `CAUSAL` changes none of them. That is why
//     `DISPATCH_SMEM_CONFIG` (`mla.cuh:1100-1120`) can compare a DEVICE
//     property against those literals and then size the launch with a
//     `sizeof`: the two agree by upstream's construction and by nothing that
//     checks. `smem_bytes_mla` below is the compiler's own answer, exported so
//     a reader can compare rather than trust -- see the echo's own comment.
//  3. **The launch must be cooperative.** `mla.cuh:1061` calls `grid.sync()`
//     between the two stages, `mla.cuh:1132` launches through
//     `cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel`, and pie's `cooperative_groups.h` shim
//     resolves `this_grid().sync()` to NVIDIA's own
//     `cudaCGGetIntrinsicHandle(scopeGrid)` / `cudaCGSynchronize(handle, 0)`
//     pair. A NON-cooperative launch of this kernel is not an error at any
//     layer; it is a deadlock in the second stage.
//
//     That pair lowers to `.extern .func` and **whether `cuModuleLoadData`
//     resolves it is UNMEASURED** -- the shim carries the marker
//     `CG_SYNC_RESOLUTION_UNMEASURED` and that is the line to read first if
//     MLA's second stage fails at module load. `libcudadevrt.a` contains no
//     `cudaCG*`, and it contains no `cudaGraphSetConditional` either, which is
//     the case where the driver resolved it anyway.
//
// # What this unit needs from NVRTC, and what it does not
//
// `--device-as-default-execution-space`, and it is **measured, not assumed**.
// Without it this root is rejected sixteen times: `csrc/shim/type_traits:253`,
// seven sites in `cascade.cuh` and eight in `prefill.cuh`, all
// *"A function without execution space annotations ... is considered a host
// function"*. `mla.cuh:33` includes `prefill.cuh`, which is the same closure
// `families::fa2` compiles and the same flag it passes (`families/fa2.rs:302`),
// so this is that entry's third instance rather than a new class. The flag is
// per-unit and not global for the reason `unit::Unit::options` gives: it would
// silently compile OUR unannotated host helpers onto the device.
//
// It needs `Headers::LibraryAndVendor` for `fa2.cuh`'s reason -- the whole
// vendored FlashInfer closure -- and `csrc/src/unit.rs`'s `DEMANDS` says so
// under the exact key `attn/attention_mla_fa2`. Exact and not a prefix:
// there is one unit and a rename should be a compile error.
//
// It needs no toolkit include path. With the flag, the whole root compiles
// clean against `csrc/{shim,vendor,src}` alone, and all six kernel name
// expressions plus all three `&`-prefixed echoes lower (`compute_89`,
// 2.3 MB of PTX, six `.entry`).
//
// # Every name below arrives from `carried.rs`, not from a search path
//
// This crate's NVRTC passes NO `-I`. `fa2.cuh`'s header is the full account;
// the consequence here is that `"attn/flashinfer/attention/mla.cuh"` resolves
// because `csrc/src/attn/flashinfer/attention/mla.cuh` is carried under
// exactly that name, and that it is QUOTED, so
// `tests/layers.rs::every_include_reachable_from_a_unit_resolves` — which
// walks quoted includes only — now covers it. It did not while the spelling
// was `<flashinfer/attention/mla.cuh>`.
