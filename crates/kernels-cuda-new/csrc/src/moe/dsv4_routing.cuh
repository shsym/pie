//===-- dsv4_routing.cuh - DeepSeek-V4's two routers ----------------------===//
//
// Two `__global__` templates and the one `__device__` helper they share. No
// launcher, and no second compiler: `dsv4_routing.cu` used to include this
// file and keep the `<<<>>>`, so the kernels had a single definition that
// nvcc and NVRTC both read. That `.cu` is DELETED —
// `topk_sqrtsoftplus_bf16`'s launcher went in §43.9 and `hash_route_lookup`'s
// is `driver-cuda/src/fire/dsv4_routing.rs` — so NVRTC is the only reader
// left. `hash_route_lookup` is fired by name as `moe::hash_route_lookup_dev`;
// `families::moe` says why the name has a suffix.
//
// # Why both kernels are here and not one each
//
// They share `sqrtsoftplus`, and a shared helper is what decides the grain of
// a unit — `new-horizon.md` §10.5. Split across two headers, the helper is
// either duplicated (two definitions, drifting) or promoted to a third header
// that exists only to hold it. One unit, one compile, one copy of the maths
// that both routers agree on.
//
// # sqrt(softplus(x)) is the whole routing decision
//
// vLLM's `_topk_softplus_sqrt_torch` is what a DeepSeek-V4 checkpoint's
// weights were trained against, and the hash router below reproduces it
// exactly: the expert INDICES are a pure function of the token id, but the
// WEIGHTS still come from the logits, gathered at the hashed indices and
// renormalized across the K picks. A uniform `1/K` is a different model.
//
// The `x > 20` branch is not an optimisation. `expf(x)` overflows to inf a
// little past 88 and `log1pf(inf)` is inf, so a large logit would route with
// an infinite weight and renormalize every other expert to zero; past 20 the
// two expressions agree to well within bf16 anyway.
//
// # One row of the two, and the axis that separates them
//
// `topk_sqrtsoftplus` fires one block per token, 256 threads, with a staging
// loop that steps by `blockDim.x` — which is `LaunchRule::Rms` exactly, so
// it is rowed. The 32 bytes that rule hands the launch as dynamic shared
// memory are never read: this kernel reduces on thread 0 and never calls
// `device::block_sum`.
//
// `hash_route_lookup` fires one THREAD per token, `ceil(tokens / 256)`
// blocks. No ported rule produces that: `Elementwise` sizes on
// `rows · width`, and this statement's width is `top_k`, so a row would ask
// for `top_k` times the threads the launcher asks for and lean on the
// `n >= tokens` guard to discard the rest. It is carried as device text and
// left unrowed; the launcher below stays the only thing that fires it.
