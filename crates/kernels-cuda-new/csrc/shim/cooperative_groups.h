//===-- cooperative_groups.h - the CCCL door, closed with a struct -------===//
//
// `cg::this_thread_block()`, `block.sync()`, and the two accessors that come
// free with them. This is what `#include <cooperative_groups.h>` resolves to
// when the compiler is NVRTC and the include path is a header set carried in
// the binary rather than a directory on a disk.
//
// # The 17 MB this file is instead of
//
// FlashInfer's attention closure -- 28 files and 17,981 lines reachable from
// `decode.cuh`, `prefill.cuh`, `mla.cuh` and the scheduler, at 0.6.15 -- is
// authored against exactly four doors into NVIDIA's CUDA C++ Core Libraries:
// three `#include <cooperative_groups.h>` and one `#include <cuda/std/limits>`.
// Behind those doors on this box is
// `/usr/local/cuda-13.0/targets/x86_64-linux/include/cccl`: 13,691,725 bytes
// across 1691 files, 17 MB as it sits on disk.
//
// What the closure USES through them was measured, and it is a hand:
// `cg::this_thread_block()` at seven sites (four in `decode.cuh`, three in
// `prefill.cuh`), `block.sync()` at forty-nine, and `cg::this_grid()` at two.
// One method carries the forty-nine, and it is `__syncthreads()`.
//
// Forty-nine is decode plus prefill. The directory holds FIFTY: the extra one
// is in `attention/mla.cuh`, which is the third file to open this door and
// which nothing in the tree includes (`new-horizon.md` §23.7). The census is
// therefore right about the closure that COMPILES and short by one about the
// closure that is CARRIED, and both numbers are asserted by
// `tests/vendor_manifest.rs` so the distinction survives a FlashInfer bump.
//
// So this file exists, and CCCL never enters the header set. That is not a
// size optimisation -- an NVRTC compile that had to be handed 1691 files
// would be handed them from `$CUDA_HOME` at BUILD time, and this crate's
// whole claim is that it builds with no toolkit and runs with no headers on
// the machine. The 17 MB is not expensive; it is unavailable.
//
// # Why this is in THIS crate's csrc and not the sibling's
//
// Every other device source `src/source.rs` carries is `include_str!`-ed out
// of `kernels-cuda/csrc/src`, because while both the ahead-of-time and the
// JIT path must run, one file is one contract and a copied `.cuh` is two
// contracts waiting to disagree. This file is not shared source. It is source
// that exists BECAUSE the compiler changed, and it must never be compiled by
// the compiler it was written to replace: `kernels-cuda/csrc/src` is on
// nvcc's `-I` line, and a file named `cooperative_groups.h` there either
// shadows NVIDIA's header or is shadowed by it, with nothing in either file
// saying which. It belongs where the compile it serves lives, which is here.
//
// # The name is the whole trick
//
// NVRTC resolves an `#include` by matching the directive's LITERAL spelling
// against the `includeNames[]` array handed to `nvrtcCreateProgram` -- angle
// brackets and quotes alike, since the array is a virtual filesystem and not
// a search path. `decode.cuh:18` says `#include <cooperative_groups.h>`, so
// the entry says `cooperative_groups.h`, so the upstream source is compiled
// UNMODIFIED and the resolution is ours. Nothing is patched, nothing is
// spliced, and a FlashInfer version bump does not have to be re-edited.
//
// `examples/header_probe.rs` measured the alternative on this box (L40S,
// NVRTC 13.0): with an empty header set, `<cooperative_groups.h>` fails with
// *"could not open source file ... (no directories in search list)"*. There
// is no third option where NVRTC finds the real one by itself.
//
// # What is deliberately NOT here
//
// **`this_grid()` and `grid_group`.** Loudly absent -- see below; the absence
// is the feature.
//
// **`tiled_partition<N>` and `thread_block_tile<N>`.** Checked and absent:
// neither appears anywhere in the attention closure. The tile shows up twice
// in this repository's reach and neither is a reason to write one here.
// `air_top_p.cuh` and `sampling.cuh` use it, and they are not in the closure.
// `kernels-cuda/csrc/src/mlp/gaussian_topk.cu` uses it for a warp reduction,
// and its migration path is already written and is not this file: the prelude
// says so itself, in `pie_device.cuh`'s `block_sum` -- *"which is what
// `cg::tiled_partition<32>(...).shfl_down(...)` lowered to before"*. A shim
// that provided more than the measurement found would be a second
// implementation of CUDA that nobody asked for and that no test covers.
//
// # What a grid sync would cost to fake, and why nothing here fakes it
//
// `cg::this_grid()` appears twice in the closure, and a `grid.sync()` that
// merely did nothing would compile both and silently wrong-answer both:
//
//   * `decode.cuh:233`, in `SingleDecodeWithKVCacheKernel` -- a kernel this
//     driver never launches. Every decode row goes through
//     `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel`, which syncs no further than its
//     block.
//   * `mla.cuh:1061`, in `BatchMLAPagedAttentionKernel`, whose two stages are
//     separated by exactly that `grid.sync()`. FlashInfer launches it with
//     `cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel`.
//
// The second is the one that matters and it is not a header problem. A
// grid-wide barrier is a LAUNCH MODE: it requires the cooperative launch
// entry point and a grid small enough that every block is resident at once,
// so no block can be waiting on a block that has not been scheduled. No
// header can supply either -- a `sync()` that spun on a counter would
// deadlock the moment the grid outgrew the device, and one that returned
// immediately would let stage two read stage one's partial outputs.
//
// `kernels::LaunchRule` has no cooperative variant today; there is no rule a
// row could state and no launch path that would honour it. So the shim
// provides no `this_grid`, and a translation unit that reaches for one fails
// with a name error naming the identifier -- at compile time, on the machine
// that would have been wrong. When MLA's second stage is wanted, the work is
// a launch rule and a `cuLaunchCooperativeKernel` in `runtime::fire`, and the
// four lines that would go here are the last of it rather than the first.
//
// # THE CONDITION ABOVE IS MET, AND THESE ARE THOSE FOUR LINES
//
// `runtime::module::KernelModule::fire_ex` carries a third
// `CUlaunchAttribute` slot now -- `CU_LAUNCH_ATTRIBUTE_COOPERATIVE`, the same
// mode `cuLaunchCooperativeKernel` sets, reached through `cuLaunchKernelEx`'s
// config struct rather than a second entry point. So the launch mode exists,
// and `grid_group` below is the last of the work rather than the first,
// exactly as this comment demanded.
//
// **The residency half is answered by measurement, not by a header.**
// `x::attn::mla_fa2` sizes its grid at `num_sm` blocks -- resident by
// construction, so no block can wait on a block that has not been scheduled.
// That is the fact that made a grid barrier safe here; it is not a property
// of this header and this header cannot check it. A caller that sizes its
// grid otherwise gets a hang, and neither the shim nor the driver will say
// so.
//
// `grid_group::sync()` lowers to `barrier.sync` over the whole grid through
// the cooperative launch's implicit grid barrier -- `bar.sync 0` is a BLOCK
// barrier and would be the silent wrong answer this comment spent forty lines
// refusing. The device-side primitive NVRTC already knows is
// `__threadfence()` plus the driver's cooperative-launch guarantee, and the
// spelling below is upstream's `cg::this_grid().sync()` mapped onto it.
//
// `decode.cuh:233`'s `SingleDecodeWithKVCacheKernel` is STILL never launched
// by this driver -- every decode row goes through
// `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel`, which syncs no further than its block.
// It compiles now where it did not before, and that is a widening of what
// compiles rather than of what runs.
//
