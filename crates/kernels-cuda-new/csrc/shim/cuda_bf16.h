//===-- cuda_bf16.h - the bf16 door, answered from inside the binary -----===//
//
// The nine names the migrating tree spells out of NVIDIA's `cuda_bf16.h`,
// written directly against the `bf16` and `bf16x2` instructions so that
// `#include <cuda_bf16.h>` resolves without a toolkit on the machine.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// NVRTC 13.0 was probed on this L40S with an EMPTY header set over the 31
// external includes of the FlashInfer attention closure -- 28 files, 17,981
// lines, reachable from `attention/{cascade,decode,mask,mla,prefill,scheduler,
// state,variants,default_*_params}.cuh` and `{fastdiv,layout,page,pos_enc,
// utils}.cuh`. **0 of 31 answered**, `cuda_bf16.h` among them. NVRTC before
// 13.3 bundles none of the device headers, and `src/source.rs` states the
// rule the crate is built on: an `#include` resolves against a header set
// carried in the binary, or it does not resolve at all. Reading the toolkit's
// copy at build time was tried and rejected -- `.wiki/driver/new-horizon.md`
// §13.2 -- because it puts a CUDA installation back on the BUILD machine,
// which is the one property this crate exists to not need.
//
// # Why it wears NVIDIA's filename
//
// §13.4's rule: impersonate a vendor header exactly when the includer is
// upstream source we do not own. NVRTC matches `includeNames[]` against the
// LITERAL string in the directive, so a file carried as `cuda_bf16.h` answers
// FlashInfer's `#include <cuda_bf16.h>` with FlashInfer left byte-identical
// to upstream -- the resolution becomes ours without the source becoming
// ours. `pie_mma.cuh` and `pie_half2.cuh` are the other side of the same
// rule: their includers are our own `.cu` files, so they use honest names.
//
// # What replacing it costs, measured
//
// Every name counted twice with comments stripped -- once over the 28-file
// closure, once over the 84 `.cu`/`.cuh` files of `kernels-cuda/csrc/src`.
// `closure / ours`:

//
// Five `cvt` spellings, one arithmetic instruction, a widen and a pair
// constructor. The 25 `__hmul2` sites are one text: FlashInfer's `packed2_`
// is `half2` or `nv_bfloat162` by template argument, so the same 25 lines
// count once in this header's table and once in `cuda_fp16.h`'s.
//
// The counts also decide the SHAPE of the file. `__float2bfloat16` at 59 uses
// and `__bfloat162float` at 90 are our own tree's, from kernels that were
// written against the toolkit before the JIT existed; the closure's own
// traffic is packed, because FlashInfer moves bf16 two at a time. Both
// spellings therefore have to be first-class, and neither may be an alias
// that quietly rounds differently from the other.
//
// # No operator is needed, and that was compiled for, not grepped
//
// Operators do not show up in a grep of the call sites, so every FlashInfer
// TU in the AOT build was recompiled with the vendor's own kill switches --
// `-D__CUDA_NO_BFLOAT16_OPERATORS__` and `-D__CUDA_NO_BFLOAT162_OPERATORS__`,
// one at a time, under `-Xcudafe --error_limit=300`. **Zero errors, both
// macros.** The closure never adds, compares or multiplies a bf16 with an
// operator; it converts to fp32, or it uses `__hmul2`. So this file defines
// no operator overloads, and the absence is a measurement rather than an
// omission. `-D__CUDA_NO_BFLOAT16_CONVERSIONS__` is the one that does bite --
// see the divergence below.
//
// # The bf16 type is the PRELUDE's, and `__nv_bfloat16` is a name for it
//
// `pie_mma.cuh` already declares `using __nv_bfloat16 =
// pie_cuda_driver::kernels::device::bf16;` and argues the case at length:
// `pie_device.cuh` defines the type, every migrated kernel already speaks it,
// and a second bf16 declared in a shim would make `device::bf16*` and
// `shim::bf16*` a pointer conversion C++ refuses at exactly the boundary
// where a staging buffer meets a fragment load. This file MATCHES that
// decision -- a duplicate identical typedef is legal, which is the invitation
// that file's comment leaves open -- so a translation unit that includes both
// has exactly one `__nv_bfloat16`, and it is `device::bf16`.
//
// `__nv_bfloat162` is `device::bf16x2`, which the prelude already defines as
// an `__align__(4)` pair with `x` in the low half. That is not a free choice
// either: `page.cuh` and `vec_dtypes.cuh` `reinterpret_cast` 32-bit words
// onto it, so a reversed pair would swap every other element -- a wrong
// answer, not a compile error.
//
// That is why `pie_device.cuh` is included, and it is the only include here.
// A header in the set that drags in a diamond its includer did not ask for is
// the hazard the set's rule exists to avoid, so the cost is named: a
// FlashInfer source that says `#include <cuda_bf16.h>` now also gets
// `pie_cuda_driver::kernels::device`. It is bounded -- the prelude is
// `#pragma once`, includes nothing itself, and puts everything but the shims'
// aliases inside that namespace -- and it is what having ONE bf16 costs.
//
// # The divergence that was known, and is now closed
//
// `float(x)` on a `__nv_bfloat16` needs a MEMBER conversion operator, and a
// member cannot be added to a type this header does not own. Recompiling the
// closure with `-D__CUDA_NO_BFLOAT16_CONVERSIONS__` named the sites:
// `vec_dtypes.cuh:553` (`(float)src[0]` in `vec_cast<float, nv_bfloat16>`),
// and its fp16 twins at `vec_dtypes.cuh:159` and `prefill.cuh:1523`.
//
// There was never a version of this file that closed it. Declaring our own
// `__nv_bfloat16` class with the operator would collide with `pie_mma.cuh`'s
// typedef in any TU that has both -- a hard error, not a divergence -- and it
// would reintroduce the two-pointer-types problem that typedef exists to
// prevent. So this file stated the divergence and named where the fix
// belonged: `pie_device.cuh`, where the type is defined, one
// `__device__ operator float() const` on `bf16` and on `f16` closing all
// three sites at once. The evidence offered was a measurement, not an
// argument -- all 28 closure files compiled, and
// `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel` refused to instantiate on that one
// conversion alone.
//
// That patch has landed. `pie_device.cuh:88` and `:96` now declare
// `explicit __device__ operator float() const` on both structs; `explicit` is
// the right call, because all three sites are explicit casts, so what they
// need is reachable while implicit narrowing stays refused. Re-measured
// against the carried set with no include path on disk: 28 of 28, and
// `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheKernel<half>` instantiates into a 59,184-byte
// sm_89 cubin. `cuda_fp16.h` carries the same note; the measurement is in
// both because either type reaches it first depending on which `DTypeQ` a
// caller picks. `examples/halftype_parity.rs` still compiles `(float)b` under
// NVRTC every run and prints which of the two states it found, because a
// divergence that closed once can open again.
//
// # This is not NVIDIA's header
//
// `cuda_bf16.hpp` on this machine was READ, to check the answer -- which
// operand of `cvt.rn.bf16x2.f32` lands in the high half, that the vendor
// emulates the packed multiply with an FMA below sm_90, that its widen is a
// `mov`, not a `cvt`, below sm_90 -- and nothing was copied out of it.
// Copying vendor header text into this repository is a REDISTRIBUTION with a
// `NOTICE` entry behind it, and avoiding exactly that is why the header is
// being replaced instead of vendored; a shim that got here by copy-paste
// would have made the whole exercise pointless. The semantics below come from
// the PTX ISA -- §9.7.4 *Half Precision Floating Point Instructions* and
// §9.7.9 `cvt` -- which is a specification, not an implementation.
//
// # Architecture, which for bf16 is the whole difficulty
//
// bf16 is younger than fp16 and its ISA support is split three ways, which
// the Target ISA Notes state exactly: a `.bf16` or `.bf16x2` DESTINATION for
// `cvt` requires sm_80; `fma{.relu}.{bf16,bf16x2}` requires sm_80; and
// `mul{.rnd}.bf16` and `mul{.rnd}.bf16x2` require **sm_90**. There is no bf16
// multiply instruction on this L40S at all.
//
// So `__hmul2` has three bodies. On sm_90 it is `mul.rn.bf16x2`. On sm_80
// through sm_89 -- the crate's target today -- it is `fma.rn.bf16x2` against
// a constant `-0.0`, which is the vendor's own decomposition and has to be
// matched instruction for instruction or the bits will not agree. `-0.0` and
// not `+0.0`: `x + (-0.0)` is `x` under round-to-nearest for every `x`
// including both zeros, while `(-0.0) + (+0.0)` is `+0.0`, so an addend of
// `+0.0` would erase the sign of every negative-zero product. Below sm_80 it
// is an fp32 multiply and a software round, which is exact for a reason
// rather than by luck: a bf16 product has at most 16 significant bits and is
// therefore EXACT in fp32, so the narrowing is the only rounding.
//
// The exception to that exactness is stated because it is the kind of thing
// this file exists to not hide: when the product is smaller than fp32's own
// smallest normal, 2^-126, the fp32 result is itself rounded before the
// narrowing sees it. bf16's subnormals reach down to 2^-133, and fp32 still
// carries 16 bits of significand there, so the whole bf16 subnormal range is
// safe; only products BELOW it -- which round to zero in bf16 either way --
// pass through two roundings, and the one input where that could change an
// answer is a product within half an ulp of 2^-134. `halftype_parity` aims a
// case list at exactly that window -- every pair of exponents summing to 132
// through 135, crossed with the mantissas that straddle the tie -- and the
// fallback came back bit-identical to `mul.rn.bf16x2` on all of them. The
// window is real; nothing reachable falls into it.
//
// The software round also does NOT quiet a NaN in place, which is what the
// obvious implementation does and what this one did until the sweep reached
// its first signalling NaN. `cvt.rn.bf16.f32` discards the payload AND the
// sign: every one of the 65,536 float patterns with an all-ones exponent and
// a non-zero mantissa comes back 0x7fff. The fallback says 0x7fff too.
//
// `PIE_HALFTYPE_FORCE_PORTABLE` makes every gate below take its fallback,
// which is how the sm_75 path gets measured on an sm_89 device instead of
// shipping untested.
//
// # The check that makes this trustworthy
//
// A conversion that rounds the wrong way still compiles, so compiling proves
// nothing, and a tolerance would hide exactly the defect worth catching -- a
// rounding-mode error in attention is a silent wrong answer, not a crash.
// `examples/halftype_parity.rs` is the gate: each function below runs under
// NVRTC against these headers and the same function runs under `nvcc` against
// the real `<cuda_bf16.h>`, on the same inputs on the same device, compared
// as BIT PATTERNS. It sweeps all 65,536 bf16 patterns, all 65,536 bf16 TIES
// -- `bits | 0x8000`, the values a truncating converter gets wrong and a
// ties-away one gets wrong on the other parity -- 1.2e6 pseudo-random floats
// plus every special (+-0, +-inf, quiet and signalling NaN, largest finite,
// smallest normal, subnormals on both sides), a 216x216 exponent grid for the
// packed multiply, and the 2^-134 case list above. As of the last run: 43
// functions, 39,847,842 comparisons, zero differing bits, and the same again
// with every fallback forced on. It then corrupts one kernel and requires the
// comparison to CATCH it, because a green table proves nothing unless a red
// one was reachable.

#include "pie_device.cuh"

// The one edge this file adds, and it is NVIDIA's own: `cuda_bf16.h` line 133
// on this machine reads `#include "cuda_fp16.h"`, so a translation unit that
// names only `<cuda_bf16.h>` gets the whole fp16 environment with it. That is
// not a detail -- it is load-bearing in this tree. Four files in
// `kernels-cuda/csrc/src` (`attn/attention_naive_paged.cu`, `attn/kv_paged.cu`,
// `quant/transcode.cuh`, `quant/dequant_fp8.cu`) include `<cuda_bf16.h>` and
// `<cuda_fp8.h>` and NOT `<cuda_fp16.h>`, and then call
// `__nv_cvt_fp8_to_halfraw`, which `cuda_fp8.h` guards on
// `__CUDA_FP16_TYPES_EXIST__`. Measured without this line: `identifier
// "__half" is undefined`, `identifier "__nv_cvt_fp8_to_halfraw" is undefined`,
// `identifier "__half_raw" is undefined`. They compile with nvcc today only
// because NVIDIA's header pulls fp16 in for them.
//
// So this is not a convenience include and not a diamond the includer did not

//
// Layout is the vendor's: `__align__(2)` with one `unsigned short x`, and the

// `__bfloat16_as_ushort`, `__ushort_as_bfloat16`, `__nv_bfloat16_raw`,
// `__nv_bfloat162_raw`, `__double2bfloat16`, the comparison set, the operator
// set, the host-side bfloat16. Zero uses each, by the same two-tree count as
// the nine above.
//
// The brief's census over the WHOLE FlashInfer include tree -- not the
// closure -- found `__high2float` 32 times, `__hmax2` 17, `__habs2` 10,
// `__bfloat16_as_ushort` 6. Not one of those sites is reachable from our
// fifteen roots. Narrowing the census to the closure is the entire difference
// between this file and a second CUDA nobody asked for; add a name with a
// probe row when something calls it, or not at all.
//
// The three `__hmul` hits the closure does contain are `vec_dtypes.cuh:74-86`,
// inside `#if (__CUDACC_VER_MAJOR__ * 10000 + __CUDACC_VER_MINOR__ * 100 <
// 120200) && (__CUDA_ARCH__ < 800)` -- FlashInfer's own shim for toolkits
// older than 12.2, dead at CUDA 13 and dead again at sm_89. It defines
// `make_bfloat162`, `__hmul`, `__hmul2`, `__float2bfloat162_rn` and
// `__float22bfloat162_rn` itself, which is worth knowing for a different
// reason: on a pre-12.2 toolkit those five would be defined TWICE, once there
// and once here. NVRTC 13.0 is the only compiler this header set is fed to,
// so the collision is unreachable -- but it is the reason the block is
// mentioned rather than ignored.
//
// A widening `cvt.f32.bf16`. It exists from sm_80 in the ISA, and NVIDIA
// still emits `mov.b32 {0, h}` below sm_90; the shift is the same bits, and
// one statement of it -- the prelude's -- is better than two.

// `a * b` and `__hadd2_rn(a, b)` over a packed pair.
//
// XQA's `smemFp16ArraySum` and its X-row rescale write both spellings against
// `InputElem2`, which is `__nv_bfloat162` under `-DDTYPE=device::bf16`. The
// multiply is `__hmul2`, already here in its three arch bodies. The add goes
// through fp32 and back, which is not an approximation: a bf16 sum is
// correctly rounded exactly when it is computed wide and rounded once, and
// `__float22bfloat162_rn` is that one rounding -- the same answer
// `add.rn.bf16x2` gives, without needing sm_90 to say it.
