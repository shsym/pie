//! The prelude's conversions, swept exhaustively against an independent
//! implementation.
//!
//! # The defect this exists because of
//!
//! `pie_device.cuh` widened fp16 with
//!
//! ```text
//! return __int_as_float(s) + (m == 0 ? 0.f : 2^-24 * m);
//! ```
//!
//! which reads as right and is not. `__int_as_float(s)` is `-0.0f` when the
//! sign bit is set, and **`-0.0 + x` is `+x`** for every positive `x`. So all
//! 1,023 negative fp16 subnormals widened POSITIVE, and `-0.0` widened to
//! `+0.0`: a sign flip on the smallest magnitudes, in a header carried by
//! every JIT unit in this crate.
//!
//! It survived a whole migration. Every test that read a normal number
//! passed, because the defect is confined to one exponent — `e == 0` — and
//! nothing sampled it. Reverting the fix and re-running this file reports
//! **1,024 mismatches, the first at `0x8000`**, which is exactly `-0.0`.
//!
//! # Why the reference is written here rather than borrowed
//!
//! The obvious reference is `__half2float` out of `cuda_fp16.h`. This file
//! does not use it, for two reasons that are the same reason: the crate
//! deliberately carries no NVIDIA header (see `new-horizon.md` §13), and a
//! test whose oracle is the thing being replaced cannot outlive the
//! replacement. The oracle below is fifteen lines of Rust written from the
//! IEEE-754 binary16 definition — an INDEPENDENT implementation, which is
//! what makes an agreement worth something.
//!
//! # Exhaustive, because sampling is what failed
//!
//! All 65,536 patterns, not a sample. There are only 65,536, the sweep costs
//! one launch, and the defect above is precisely what a sample misses.
