//! Do `cuda_fp8.h`, `cuda_fp4.h`, `cuda/cmath` and `cuda/pipeline` compute
//! what NVIDIA's own headers compute?
//!
//! # The question this answers, and why compiling is not it
//!
//! Four files in `csrc/shim` wear NVIDIA's filenames so that unmodified
//! FlashInfer source resolves them under NVRTC, where there is no include
//! path on disk and `examples/header_probe.rs` measured **0 of 31** external
//! directives answered against an empty header set. Every one of the four is
//! a chance to be quietly wrong:
//!
//! * a converter that rounds a subnormal the other way, or saturates one ulp
//!   late, produces a KV cache that is slightly off and a model that is
//!   slightly worse -- never a crash, never a stack trace;
//! * a lane swap in `cvt.rn.satfinite.e4m3x2.f32` -- the instruction packs
//!   TWO floats and a scalar conversion is that instruction with one lane
//!   discarded -- transposes every fp8 pair in the tree and still compiles;
//! * a `cuda::pipeline` that copies the right bytes and commits at the wrong
//!   time passes any single-threaded check ever written, and fails one launch
//!   in ten thousand on a customer's machine.
//!
//! So this probe does not ask whether the headers compile. It asks whether
//! they produce, bit for bit, what the vendor's implementation produces on
//! the same device from the same input -- and where no vendor implementation
//! exists on this machine, what the hardware itself produces.
//!
//! # Four gates, three kinds of reference
//!
//! | header | reference | what would slip past a weaker gate |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `cuda_fp8.h` | `nvcc` against the real `<cuda_fp8.h>` | subnormals, saturation, NaN payloads, the packed lane order |
//! | `cuda_fp4.h` | `nvcc` against the real `<cuda_fp4.h>` | a storage width or an enumerator that disagrees across a TU boundary |
//! | `cuda/cmath` | the device's own `u32 / u32` | the `d == 1` case, where the 64-bit magic overflows and every quotient becomes zero |
//! | `cuda/pipeline` | `nvcc` against the toolkit's real `<cuda/pipeline>`, plus a host reference, plus two negative controls | a missing `wait_group` or a missing `__syncthreads()` |
//!
//! Both fp8 kernels are the SAME text compiled twice: `nvcc -cubin` against
//! `/usr/local/cuda/.../cuda_fp8.h`, and NVRTC against a [`Header`] array
//! built in this file out of `include_str!`. One source, two compilers, two
//! header sets, one device, no tolerance.
//!
//! The fp16 and bf16 types the fp8 classes convert through are supplied by
//! THIS FILE on the NVRTC side, as a nine-line ABI-compatible prelude, and by
//! `<cuda_fp16.h>`/`<cuda_bf16.h>` on the nvcc side. That is not a shortcut:
//! `csrc/shim/cuda_fp16.h` and `cuda_bf16.h` belong to other work in this
//! crate, and the prelude here stands in for them so that
//! `__nv_fp8_e4m3(__half)` can be gated TODAY rather than after that lands.
//! The layouts are `unsigned short` on both sides, which is the whole of what
//! crosses the boundary being measured.
//!
//! # Why the negative controls are not optional
//!
//! Two of the pipeline rows are kernels that MUST fail. A staging test that
//! passes proves nothing unless the harness can see a race, and a race is
//! exactly the thing a quiet machine hides: the first control drops
//! `cp.async.wait_group`, the second keeps it and drops the `__syncthreads()`
//! that makes one thread's staged bytes visible to another. Both were
//! measured wrong on **300 of 300** launches. If either ever passes, this
//! probe has stopped measuring anything and every PASS above it is worthless.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p kernels-cuda-new --features cuda-13 --example fp8_pipeline_probe
//! ```
//!
//! Needs `nvcc` on `PATH` or at `$CUDA_HOME/bin/nvcc`, and a device of
//! `sm_89` -- `cuda_fp8.h` refuses to compile below it, on purpose, because
//! that is where the `cvt` instruction it is written on begins. Exits
//! non-zero on any FAIL.
