//! **DOES THE BLOCK DRAFTER PREDICT THE TARGET FIFTEEN TOKENS AHEAD?**
//!
//! Everything under this is proven: the drafter's planes bind, its context
//! arm leaves the trunk's logits alone, and a draft block fires and answers
//! (`the_block_drafter_loads_and_leaves_the_trunk_alone`). What none of that
//! says is whether the drafter is predicting the TARGET or merely producing
//! well-formed noise.
//!
//! **What this can and cannot see.** A host readout seat holds one row per
//! lane and it is always the lane's LAST row — `Seated::readout` steers a
//! guest epilogue's `IntrinsicId::Logits`, not this seat (`serve.rs`, "the
//! guest's own row"). So the whole sixteen-wide proposal is not readable
//! from here, and the accepted-prefix profile a round actually keeps belongs
//! to the inferlet's test. What IS exactly readable is the block's last row:
//! **the drafter's guess at the last position its block covers**,
//! against what the target really produced there. That is the hardest
//! position in the block, so agreement is a strong signal and disagreement
//! is a weak one — which is why it is sampled at several anchors and over
//! prompts of different shape rather than reported as one number.
//!
//! **The number itself has moved to the inferlet.**
//! `tests/inferlets/dflash-block-acceptance` fires the same block and reads
//! EVERY row's proposal through a guest epilogue, so it sees the accepted
//! prefix rather than one position of it. What is left here is the path: a
//! block fired at every anchor on the real checkpoint, with the context its
//! anchor had.
//!
//! **A truncated block is NOT a window onto the full one, and this was tried.**
//! Firing the block at every length 1..=16 and reading each last row would
//! recover the whole proposal from a seat that hands back one row — four of
//! the drafter's five layers are causal and windowed, so their view of row
//! `L-1` is exactly the full block's, and only the last, full-attention
//! layer sees fewer mask rows. It does not work: over twelve anchors the
//! agreements land at positions 11-15 and NEVER at 0-2, which is the
//! opposite of what a drafter does. The reason is that this is a block
//! DIFFUSION model trained at one block width, so a length-1 block is far
//! out of its distribution while a length-15 one is nearly in it. The
//! accepted-prefix profile therefore needs the real sixteen-wide pass, and
//! so it needs a guest epilogue reading `mtp.drafts`.
//!
//! Slot 0 decodes the truth autoregressively with the context arm running,
//! so the drafter's kv rows carry the history a real round would give them;
//! slot 1 prefills the same prompt, walks the same tokens, and fires one
//! full block at each anchor.
