//! Worker control-plane **seam**: the [`ControlLink`] trait the worker's
//! register + heartbeat/report/watch loops run against, plus the distributed
//! [`pie_controller_rpc::ControlClient`] implementation.
//!
//! The seam is what keeps `pie-worker` depending only on the *contract*
//! (`pie-controller-rpc`) and never on the controller *implementation* (`pie-controller`):
//!
//! - **distributed** (always linked): [`ControlLink`] for [`ControlClient`]
//!   dials the standalone controller over tarpc; [`neighbors_watch`] spawns the
//!   `watch_worker` long-poll loop and republishes each view into a local
//!   `watch` channel.
//! - **single-node** (`single-node` feature): an `EmbeddedControl(Handle)`
//!   newtype at the composition root (the worker bin's `single_node` module)
//!   implements the same trait against the in-proc controller `Handle` — no
//!   sockets, `neighbors_watch` returns the controller's `worker_watch(id)`
//!   receiver directly.
//!
//! Either backend is injected into [`spawn_control_tasks`], so the three loops
//! are transport-agnostic.
