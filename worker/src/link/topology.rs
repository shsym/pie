//! Control-plane **topology** axis: the resolved [`TopologyMode`] + the
//! [`Coordinator`] the engine boot path consumes.
//!
//! Kept orthogonal to the *backend* axis (which driver) and the *role-stage*
//! wiring. Two forms:
//!
//! - **single-node** — no controller; this one node serves every role and
//!   terminates clients directly (gateway-free local inference).
//! - **distributed** — `role` + `controller` + the `gateways` this worker dials
//!   INTO (M3 inversion), joining a cluster coordinated by a standalone
//!   controller process.
//!
//! This is a pure library surface: flag parsing lives in the bins (`bin/worker`,
//! `bin/pie`), which construct a [`TopologyMode`] (via [`TopologyMode::distributed`]
//! or [`TopologyMode::SingleNode`]) and hand it to [`connect`]. Building the
//! actual control connection (dial vs in-proc embed) is the engine boot path's
//! job ([`super::start_engine`]).
